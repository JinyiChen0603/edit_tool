## 题目
A surveying team models a mountain peak as a quadrangular pyramid $P-ABCD$. The base $ABCD$ is a flat rhombus plateau with side length $2$ km and $\angle ABC = 60^\circ$. The peak P is situated such that the vertical drop $PA$ is perpendicular to the plateau. Points $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of the boundary $BC$ and the ridge $PC$, respectively. A drone $H$ navigates along the ridge $PD$. Flight data shows that when the angle between the drone's path vector $EH$ and the face $PAD$ is maximized, the tangent of this angle is $\frac{\sqrt6}{2}$. Find the cosine of the dihedral angle $E-AF-C$ between the planes $AEF$ and $AFC$ to map the terrain accurately.

## 解答
Step 1: Determine the spatial geometric parameters. Since the base ABCD is a rhombus and $ \angle ABC = 60^\circ$, $\triangle ABC$ is an equilateral triangle. Connect $AE$. Since $E$ is the midpoint of $BC$, $AE \perp BC$.  Because $BC \parallel AD$, $AE \perp AD$. Given that $PA \perp$ plane $ABCD$, $PA \perp AE$. From $AE \perp AD$ and $AE \perp PA$, we have $AE \perp$ plane $PAD$. Let $\theta$ be the angle between $EH$ and plane $PAD$, then $\theta = \angle EHA$. In the right-angled triangle $\triangle EAH$, $\tan\theta = \dfrac{AE}{AH}$. $\theta$ is maximized when $AH$ is minimized (i.e., $AH \perp PD$). Given $AE=\sqrt{3}$ and $\tan\theta=\dfrac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$, we have $\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{AH}=\dfrac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$, solving for $AH=\sqrt{2}$. In the right-angled triangle $\triangle PAD$, $AD=2$, and $AH=\sqrt{2}$ is the altitude to the hypotenuse, so $PA=2$.

Step 2: Establish a spatial rectangular coordinate system. Using point $A$ as the origin, and rays $AE$, $AD$, and $AP$ as the positive directions of the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes respectively, we establish a spatial rectangular coordinate system. The coordinates of the points are $A(0,0,0)$, $B(\sqrt{3},-1,0)$, $C(\sqrt{3},1,0)$, $D(0,2,0)$, and $P(0,0,2)$. Using the midpoint formula, we get $E(\sqrt{3},0,0)$ and $F\left(\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\dfrac{1}{2},1\right)$.

Step 3: Calculate the normal vector and the dihedral angle. Let the normal vector of plane $AEF$ be $\vec n_1=(x,y,z)$. From $\vec n_1\cdot\vec{AE}=0$ and $\vec n_1\cdot\vec{AF}=0$, we get $\sqrt{3}x=0$ and $\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x+\dfrac{1}{2}y+z=0$.  Let $z=-1$, then we solve for $\vec n_1=(0,2,-1)$. Connect $BD$. It is easy to prove that $BD \perp AC$ and $BD \perp PA$, therefore $BD \perp$ plane $AFC$.  Since $\vec{BD}=(-\sqrt{3},3,0)$, we can take it as a normal vector of plane $AFC$, i.e., $\vec n_2=(-\sqrt{3},3,0)$. Let the dihedral angle $E-AF-C$ be $\phi$, then $\cos\phi=\dfrac{|\vec n_1\cdot\vec n_2|}{|\vec n_1|\,|\vec n_2|}$. Substituting the values, we get $\cos\phi=\dfrac{6}{\sqrt{5}\,\sqrt{12}}=\dfrac{6}{2\sqrt{15}}=\dfrac{3}{\sqrt{15}}=\dfrac{\sqrt{15}}{5}$. Therefore, the cosine of the dihedral angle $E-AF-C$ is $\dfrac{\sqrt{15}}{5}$.

## 答案
$$\frac{\sqrt{15}}{5}$$
