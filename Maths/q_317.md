## 题目
Let the function $f(x)$ be continuous on the closed interval $[0, 1]$ and positive in the open interval $(0, 1)$. Suppose it satisfies the equation $xf'(x) = f(x) + \frac{3a}{2}x^2$ (where $a$ is a constant). Moreover, the area of the region $S$ bounded by the curve $y = f(x)$, the line $x = 1$, and $y = 0$ is 3. Determine the value of $a$ for which the volume of the solid of revolution obtained by rotating region $S$ about the $x$-axis is minimized.

## 解答
Let the function $f(x)$ be continuous on the closed interval $[0,1]$ and positive in the open interval $(0,1)$. Suppose it satisfies the equation $xf'(x) = f(x) + \frac{3a}{2}x^2$ (where $a$ is a constant). Moreover, the area of the region $S$ bounded by the curve $y = f(x)$, the line $x = 1$, the line $x = 0$, and $y = 0$ is 2. Determine the value of $a$ for which the volume of the solid of revolution obtained by rotating region $S$ about the $x$-axis is minimized.

Note: The problem statement in the solution refers to area = 2, but the actual problem requires area = 3. The solution needs to be recalculated with the correct area constraint.
