## 题目
A beam of light strikes line segment ( $BC$ ) at point ( $C$ ) with an angle of incidence ( $\alpha = 19.94^\circ$ ) and reflects with an equal angle of reflection as shown. The light beam continues along its path, reflecting off line segments ( $AB$ ) and ( $BC$ ) according to the rule that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Given that ( $\beta = \alpha/10 = 1.994^\circ$ ) and ( $AB = BC$ ), calculate the number of times the light beam will bounce off the two line segments. Include the first reflection at ( $C$ ) in your count.

## 解答
At the point of reflection, we pretend instead that the light continues to travel straight.
Note that after $k$ reflections (excluding the first one at $C$) the extended line will form an angle $k\beta$ at point $B$. For the $k$th reflection to be just inside or at point $B$, we must have $k\beta \leq 180 - 2\alpha \implies k \leq \frac{180 - 2\alpha}{\beta} = 70.27$.
Thus, our answer is, including the first intersection,
$$\left\lfloor \frac{180 - 2\alpha}{\beta} \right\rfloor + 1 = 071$$
