\section*{Problem Statement: Multiple Reflections in a Geometric Wedge}

\subsection*{Image Description}
The provided image illustrates a geometric construction representing the trajectory of a light beam reflecting between two boundaries. The setup is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vertex and Boundaries:} There are two line segments, $AB$ and $BC$, which meet at vertex $B$. Segment $BC$ is positioned horizontally, and segment $AB$ is inclined at an angle $\beta$ relative to $BC$.
    \item \textbf{Method of Images:} The diagram uses a "folded space" or "unrolling" technique. From the vertex $B$, several dashed lines radiate outward. These lines represent the successive mirrored positions of segments $AB$ and $BC$ as the light reflects.
    \item \textbf{Light Path:} A solid transversal line represents the straight-line path of the light beam. Red dots are marked at the intersection points where this path crosses the radiating dashed lines. The first intersection point is labeled $C$, representing the initial point of incidence.
    \item \textbf{Angular Relationship:} The angle of the incoming ray relative to segment $BC$ is denoted by $\alpha$, while the wedge angle between the two mirrors is $\beta$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Mathematical Problem}
A beam of light strikes line segment $BC$ at point $C$ with an angle of incidence $\alpha = 19.94^\circ$ and reflects with an equal angle of reflection as shown. The light beam continues along its path, reflecting off line segments $AB$ and $BC$ according to the rule that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.

Given the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The angle between the segments is $\beta = \frac{\alpha}{10} = 1.994^\circ$.
    \item The segments are of equal length, $AB = BC$.
    \item The reflection process begins at point $C$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Task:} Calculate the total number of times the light beam will bounce off the two line segments ($AB$ and $BC$). Include the first reflection at point $C$ in your final count.

## 解答
At the point of reflection, we pretend instead that the light continues to travel straight.
Note that after $k$ reflections (excluding the first one at $C$) the extended line will form an angle $k\beta$ at point $B$. For the $k$th reflection to be just inside or at point $B$, we must have $k\beta \leq 180 - 2\alpha \implies k \leq \frac{180 - 2\alpha}{\beta} = 70.27$.
Thus, our answer is, including the first intersection,
$$\left\lfloor \frac{180 - 2\alpha}{\beta} \right\rfloor + 1 = 071$$
