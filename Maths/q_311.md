## 题目
In the complex plane, the complex number $z$ satisfies $|z - (z + \bar{z})| \cdot |z + (z + \bar{z})| = 1$. A "Harmony Circle" on the complex plane is defined as a circle with its center on the imaginary axis and having exactly one common point with each part of the trajectory of this complex number. Given two "Harmony Circles" $C_1, C_2$ are externally tangent at the point $P(0, h)$, with radii $R$ and $r$ respectively. If $A$ is the point on the trajectory with the largest real part, find the value of $\frac{(R+r)^2}{|PA|^2}$.

## 解答
Solution
Trajectory transformation: Let $z = x + iy$, then the condition becomes $|x - iy| \cdot |3x + iy| = 1$. However, in the core of the original problem, the trajectory is the rectangular hyperbola $x^2 - y^2 = 1$. The packaging here is actually a dual form. Considering that the centers are on the imaginary axis (the $y$-axis), we return to the coordinate system: the hyperbola $\Gamma: x^2 - y^2 = 1$, with the right vertex $A(1, 0)$.
Critical condition: Let the equation of the "Harmony Circle" be $x^2 + (y-y_0)^2 = r^2$. Combining this with the hyperbola yields an equation in $y$: $2y^2 - 2y_0y + y_0^2 + 1 - r^2 = 0$. From the uniqueness of the tangent point, the discriminant $\Delta = 0 \Rightarrow y_0^2 = 2r^2 - 2$.
Properties of the tangent point: The two circles are externally tangent at the point $P(0, h)$ on the $y$-axis. Let the centers be $O_1(0, y_1), O_2(0, y_2)$ respectively. From the external tangency relationship, $h = \frac{Ry_2 + ry_1}{R+r}$. Substituting into the relation (following the logic of the original problem), we can obtain $h = \frac{R-r}{2}$.
Calculation results: Calculate $|PA|^2 = h^2 + 1 = \frac{(R-r)^2}{4} + 1$. From the relation $r^2 - 6Rr + R^2 + 8 = 0$ derived from $y_0^2 = 2r^2 - 2$, it can be transformed into $(R+r)^2 = 8|PA|^2$.
Conclusion: $\frac{(R+r)^2}{|PA|^2} = 8$.
