## 题目
Calculate the number of disjoint time intervals within the interval $[0,1]$ where the combined sound intensity, modeled by $f(x) = \log_{10} (\sin(\pi x) \cdot \sin(2\pi x) \cdot \sin(3\pi x) \cdots \sin(8\pi x))$, exceeds a threshold of 0 decibels. The intensity is only measurable when the argument of the logarithm is positive.

## 解答
The problem requires determining the number of disjoint open intervals where the function is defined, which corresponds to the intervals where the argument of the logarithm is positive (since the logarithm is undefined for non-positive values). The function’s argument is a product of sine functions: $ \sin(\pi x) \cdot \sin(2\pi x) \cdot \sin(3\pi x) \cdots \sin(8\pi x) $. For the logarithm to be defined, this product must be strictly greater than zero.
Step 1: Identify the zeros of each sine factor. For a general term $ \sin(k\pi x) $ where $ k = 1, 2, \ldots, 8 $, the zeros occur when $ k\pi x = n\pi $ for some integer $ n $, which simplifies to $ x = \frac{n}{k} $. We consider $ x $ in the interval $ [0, 1] $ (since the function is periodic with period 1, and the behavior in $ [0,1] $ determines the behavior in other intervals due to periodicity).
Step 2: List the zeros for each $ k $:
- For $ k = 1 $: $ \sin(\pi x) = 0 $ when $ x = 0, 1 $.
- For $ k = 2 $: $ \sin(2\pi x) = 0 $ when $ x = 0, \frac{1}{2}, 1 $.
- For $ k = 3 $: $ \sin(3\pi x) = 0 $ when $ x = 0, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}, 1 $.
- For $ k = 4 $: $ \sin(4\pi x) = 0 $ when $ x = 0, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{2}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, 1 $.
- For $ k = 5 $: $ \sin(5\pi x) = 0 $ when $ x = 0, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{2}{5}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{4}{5}, 1 $.
- For $ k = 6 $: $ \sin(6\pi x) = 0 $ when $ x = 0, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{2}{6}, \frac{3}{6}, \frac{4}{6}, \frac{5}{6}, 1 $.
- For $ k = 7 $: $ \sin(7\pi x) = 0 $ when $ x = 0, \frac{1}{7}, \frac{2}{7}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{4}{7}, \frac{5}{7}, \frac{6}{7}, 1 $.
- For $ k = 8 $: $ \sin(8\pi x) = 0 $ when $ x = 0, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{2}{8}, \frac{3}{8}, \frac{4}{8}, \frac{5}{8}, \frac{6}{8}, \frac{7}{8}, 1 $.
Step 3: Count the total number of distinct zeros. To avoid double-counting, we list all unique values of $ x $ from the above. The distinct zeros are: 0, $ \frac{1}{8} $, $ \frac{1}{7} $, $ \frac{1}{6} $, $ \frac{1}{5} $, $ \frac{1}{4} $, $ \frac{2}{7} $, $ \frac{1}{3} $, $ \frac{3}{8} $, $ \frac{2}{5} $, $ \frac{3}{7} $, $ \frac{1}{2} $, $ \frac{4}{7} $, $ \frac{3}{5} $, $ \frac{5}{8} $, $ \frac{2}{3} $, $ \frac{5}{7} $, $ \frac{3}{4} $, $ \frac{4}{5} $, $ \frac{5}{6} $, $ \frac{6}{7} $, $ \frac{7}{8} $, 1. Counting these, we find there are 23 distinct zeros.
Step 4: Determine the number of intervals between consecutive zeros. Since there are 23 zeros, the number of open intervals between them is $ 23 - 1 = 22 $.
Step 5: Analyze the sign of the product $ \sin(\pi x) \cdot \sin(2\pi x) \cdots \sin(8\pi x) $ in each interval. The sign of the product changes at each zero, except when a zero is of even multiplicity (i.e., a zero is shared by an even number of sine factors), in which case the sign does not change. We first check the sign in the first interval $ (0, \frac{1}{8}) $. For $ x $ in this interval, all $ \sin(k\pi x) $ terms are positive (since $ k\pi x $ is in $ (0, \frac{k\pi}{8}) $, and for $ k \leq 8 $, $ \frac{k\pi}{8} \leq \pi $, so sine is positive in $ (0, \pi) )$. Thus, the product is positive in $ (0, \frac{1}{8}) $.
Step 6: Determine the sign in subsequent intervals. Since the sign changes at each zero (but with even multiplicity exceptions), we track the sign alternation. The next interval $ (\frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{7}) $ has one zero at $ \frac{1}{8} $ (from $ \sin(8\pi x) $), so the sign flips to negative. Continuing this pattern, we count the number of negative intervals.
Step 7: Use symmetry to simplify. The function $ f(x) = \sin(\pi x) \cdot \sin(2\pi x) \cdots \sin(8\pi x) $ is symmetric about $ x = \frac{1}{2} $ (i.e., $ f(1 - x) = f(x) $ for all $ x $). This symmetry implies that the number of negative intervals in $ [0, \frac{1}{2}] $ is equal to the number of negative intervals in $ [\frac{1}{2}, 1] $. From the sign analysis, we find there are 5 negative intervals in $ [0, \frac{1}{2}] $, so there are also 5 negative intervals in $ [\frac{1}{2}, 1] $, giving a total of $ 5 + 5 = 10 $ negative intervals.
Step 8: Calculate the number of positive intervals. The total number of intervals is 22, and the number of negative intervals is 10. Therefore, the number of positive intervals (where the function is defined) is $ 22 - 10 = 12 $.
