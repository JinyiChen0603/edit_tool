## 题目
An acoustic laboratory conducts an **experiment on multi - frequency acoustic wave resonance superposition** to study the interference effect of acoustic waves with different frequencies. In the experiment, 8 groups of resonance sensors are used to detect the resonance intensity of acoustic waves with frequencies that are \( k \) times the fundamental frequency (\( k = 1, 2, \dots, 8 \)) respectively.

Define the normalized experimental time \( \tau \) (\( \tau \in [0,1] \), where \( \tau = 0 \) corresponds to the start time of the experiment and \( \tau = 1 \) corresponds to the end time of the experiment). The instantaneous resonance intensity (dimensionless) of the \( k \)-th group of sensors can be expressed as \( \sin(k\pi \tau) \). To quantify the overall effect of resonance superposition, the experimenters define a **logarithmic comprehensive index of sound intensity**:
$$y = \log_{10}\left( \sin(\pi \tau) \cdot \sin(2\pi \tau) \cdot \dots \cdot \sin(8\pi \tau) \right)$$
The collected resonance data are judged to be valid data only when this index is meaningful. Find the number of disjoint open intervals corresponding to the valid data in the experimental time interval \( [0,1] \).

## 解答
The core of this problem is to **transform the practical requirement that ""the logarithmic comprehensive index of sound intensity is meaningful"" in acoustic experiments into a domain problem of logarithmic functions** in mathematics.

Step 1: Clarify the Necessary and Sufficient Condition for the Index to Be Meaningful
The expression for the logarithmic comprehensive index of sound intensity is:
$$y = \log_{10}\left( \sin(\pi \tau) \cdot \sin(2\pi \tau) \cdot \dots \cdot \sin(8\pi \tau) \right)$$
where \( \tau \in [0,1] \) is the normalized experimental time. For the common logarithm with base 10, **the necessary and sufficient condition for the index to be meaningful is that the argument of the logarithm is greater than 0**, i.e.:
$$\prod_{k=1}^8 \sin(k\pi \tau) > 0$$
The intervals where this inequality holds are the time periods corresponding to valid data in the experiment.

Step 2: Analyze the Zero Points and Signs of Individual Resonance Intensity Terms
For any \( k \in \{1,2,\dots,8\} \), the \( k \)-th group of sensor resonance intensity terms \( \sin(k\pi \tau) = 0 \) if and only if \( k\pi \tau = n\pi \) (\( n \in \mathbb{Z} \)), which simplifies to \( \tau = \frac{n}{k} \).
- **Physical meaning of zero points**: When \( \tau = \frac{n}{k} \), the resonance intensity of the \( k \)-th group of sensors is 0. At this time, the product of all intensity terms is 0, the logarithmic index is meaningless, and the collected data is invalid.
- **Sign rule**: In the open interval between two adjacent zero points, the sign of \( \sin(k\pi \tau) \) remains unchanged. The specific judgment rules are as follows:
  - If \( k\pi \tau \in (2m\pi, (2m+1)\pi) \) (\( m \in \mathbb{Z} \)), then \( \sin(k\pi \tau) > 0 \);
  - If \( k\pi \tau \in ((2m+1)\pi, (2m+2)\pi) \) (\( m \in \mathbb{Z} \)), then \( \sin(k\pi \tau) < 0 \).

Step 3: Find All Distinct Zero Points in \([0,1]\)
Within the experimental time interval \( [0,1] \), all possible zero points are \( \tau = \frac{n}{k} \) (where \( k=1,2,\dots,8 \) and \( n=0,1,\dots,k \)). After removing duplicate zero points, the distinct zero points in the open interval \( (0,1) \) are:
$$\frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{7}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{2}{7}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{3}{8}, \frac{2}{5}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{4}{7}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{5}{8}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{5}{7}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5}, \frac{5}{6}, \frac{6}{7}, \frac{7}{8}$$
There are 20 distinct zero points in total. These zero points divide \( (0,1) \) into **21 disjoint open intervals**. In each open interval, the sign of each \( \sin(k\pi \tau) \) remains unchanged, so the sign of the product also remains unchanged.

Step 4: Simplify the Judgment of the Product Sign Using Symmetry
It is observed that the resonance intensity terms have a symmetric property with respect to \( \tau = \frac{1}{2} \), and the proof is as follows:
$$\sin(k\pi(1-\tau)) = \sin(k\pi - k\pi \tau) = (-1)^{k+1}\sin(k\pi \tau)$$
For the product of all intensity terms \( \prod_{k=1}^8 \sin(k\pi(1-\tau)) \), the sign change factor of each term is \( (-1)^{k+1} \), and the overall sign change factor is:
$$\prod_{k=1}^8 (-1)^{k+1} = (-1)^{(1+2+\dots+8)+8} = (-1)^{44} = 1$$
Therefore, the sign of the product at \( \tau \) is **exactly the same** as that at \( 1-\tau \). Based on this symmetry, we only need to judge the product sign of each open interval in \( (0, \frac{1}{2}) \), and then symmetrically extend it to the intervals in \( (\frac{1}{2}, 1) \), which greatly simplifies the calculation.

Step 5: Judge the Product Sign and Count the Valid Intervals
The sign of the product \( \prod_{k=1}^8 \sin(k\pi \tau) \) is determined by the number of negative terms: **the product is positive when the number of negative terms is even** (which satisfies the condition for the index to be meaningful).
- Among the 11 open intervals in \( (0, \frac{1}{2}) \), there are 6 intervals where the number of negative terms is even, so the product is positive;
- By symmetry, there are also 6 intervals with positive products among the 11 open intervals in \( (\frac{1}{2}, 1) \).

Within the normalized experimental time interval \( [0,1] \), the number of disjoint open intervals corresponding to valid data is \( 6 + 6 = 12 \).
