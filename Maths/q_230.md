Problem: The Central Internal Isosceles Trapezoid

Definitions:
Let $P$ be a regular $30$-gon with vertices marked $V_0, V_1, \dots, V_{29}$ in counterclockwise order.
Let $O$ be the geometric center of $P$.
We select a set of $4$ distinct vertices to form a convex quadrilateral $Q$.

Constraints:
The quadrilateral $Q$ must satisfy all of the following conditions:
1. $Q$ is an Isosceles Trapezoid.
2. $Q$ is not a Rectangle.
3. $Q$ is Strictly Internal: No side of $Q$ (neither base nor leg) coincides with a side of the regular $30$-gon $P$.
4. $Q$ Strictly Encloses the Center: The center $O$ lies strictly inside the quadrilateral $Q$.

Question:
Calculate the total number of such quadrilaterals $Q$.

## 解答
Analysis

We analyze the axes of symmetry for the regular $30$-gon ($n=30$).

An isosceles trapezoid is formed by selecting two chords perpendicular to an axis of symmetry.

To strictly enclose the center, the two chosen chords (bases) must lie on opposite sides of the center $O$.

We classify based on the two types of axes.

1. Type 1 Axes (Passing through opposite vertices)

There are $n/2 = 15$ such axes. Let us consider the axis passing through $V_0$ and $V_{15}$.

The chords perpendicular to this axis are $C_k$ connecting $V_k$ and $V_{30-k}$ (indices mod 30).

There are 14 chords total: $C_1, C_2, \dots, C_{14}$.

The center $O$ lies between $C_7$ and $C_8$.

To enclose the center, we must select one chord from the "Upper Set" $U = \{C_1, \dots, C_7\}$ and one from the "Lower Set" $L = \{C_8, \dots, C_{14}\}$.

Strictly Internal (Bases): The shortest chords are $C_1$ ($V_1V_{29}$) and $C_{14}$ ($V_{14}V_{16}$). Their lengths correspond to spanning 2 polygon sides. Thus, no base is ever a polygon edge.

Strictly Internal (Legs): A leg connects an endpoint of $C_i \in U$ to an endpoint of $C_j \in L$.

The vertices are $V_i$ (from upper) and $V_{15-k}$ (from lower... wait, let's index carefully).

Let's denote the chosen chords by their "distance" from the poles $V_0$ and $V_{15}$.

Let $x$ be the index of the upper chord ($1 \le x \le 7$). Vertices: $V_x, V_{30-x}$.

Let $y$ be the index of the lower chord relative to $V_{15}$ ($1 \le y \le 7$). This corresponds to chord $C_{15-y}$. Vertices: $V_{15-y}, V_{15+y}$.

The leg connects $V_x$ to $V_{15-y}$.

The leg is a polygon side if these vertices are adjacent: $|(15-y) - x| = 1 \Rightarrow x+y = 14$.

We must exclude pairs $(x, y)$ where $x+y = 14$.

Range: $x \in \{1, \dots, 7\}, y \in \{1, \dots, 7\}$.

The only integer solution is $x=7, y=7$. (This corresponds to chords $C_7$ and $C_8$).

Counting Type 1: Total pairs $(x, y) = 7 \times 7 = 49$.

Subtract leg-edge cases: 1 pair $(7,7)$.

Valid Trapezoids (including Rectangles) = $49 - 1 = 48$.

Subtracting Rectangles: A rectangle occurs when $x = y$.

Possible values: $(1,1), (2,2), \dots, (7,7)$.

However, $(7,7)$ was already removed as invalid (it's a rectangle with legs as polygon edges).

Remaining rectangles: 1, \dots, 6. (6 rectangles).

Valid Type 1 Total: $48 - 6 = 42$.

Total for 15 Axes: $15 \times 42 = 630$.

2. Type 2 Axes (Passing through midpoints of opposite edges)

There are $n/2 = 15$ such axes. Consider the axis through edge $V_0V_1$ and $V_{15}V_{16}$.

The chords are $K_m$ perpendicular to this axis.

Total 15 "rungs".

$K_1$ is the edge $V_0V_1$. (Excluded: Base cannot be edge).

$K_{15}$ is the edge $V_{15}V_{16}$. (Excluded: Base cannot be edge).

The middle rung $K_8$ connects $V_8$ and $V_{23}$. This is a Diameter passing through $O$.

Center Constraint: For the center to be strictly inside, we cannot use the diameter $K_8$ as a base. We must pick one chord strictly "above" $K_8$ and one strictly "below".

Upper Set $U$: $\{K_2, K_3, K_4, K_5, K_6, K_7\}$. (6 chords).

Lower Set $L$: $\{K_9, K_{10}, K_{11}, K_{12}, K_{13}, K_{14}\}$. (6 chords).

Strictly Internal (Legs): The "closest" chords to the middle are $K_7$ and $K_9$.

$K_7$ connects $V_7, V_{24}$.

$K_9$ connects $V_9, V_{22}$.

The leg connects $V_7$ to $V_9$. The distance is 2 edges.

Since the gap across the diameter is at least 2 steps, the legs are never polygon edges in this configuration.

Counting Type 2: Total pairs = $6 \times 6 = 36$.

Subtracting Rectangles: Rectangles occur when the choice is symmetric around the diameter ($K_8$).

This implies choosing $K_i$ and $K_{16-i}$ for $i \in \{2, \dots, 7\}$.

There are 6 such pairs.

Valid Type 2 Total: $36 - 6 = 30$.

Total for 15 Axes: $15 \times 30 = 450$.

3. Final Summation
The set of isosceles trapezoids defined by vertex-axes and edge-axes are disjoint.
$$ \text{Total} = 630 + 450 = 1080 $$

## 答案
$$1080$$
