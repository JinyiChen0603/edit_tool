## 题目
Define plane vectors $\vec{m} = (x, 1)$, $\vec{n} = (x, -1)$. Let $\Gamma$ be the locus of point $M(x, y)$ satisfying $\vec{m} \cdot \vec{n} = y^2$.

Let circle $C_i$ have its center on the $y$-axis, radius $r_i$, and be tangent to $\Gamma$ (having exactly one common point in the first and second quadrants respectively). Two distinct circles $C_1, C_2$ are externally tangent at a point $P$ on the $y$-axis.

Given $A(1, 0)$ and $r_1 = 3$, find all possible values for the square of the magnitude of vector $\vec{PA}$ (i.e., $|\vec{PA}|^2$).

## 解答
## Solution

**1. Determine the Trajectory $\Gamma$**
From the dot product definition:
$$\vec{m} \cdot \vec{n} = x^2 - 1$$
Equating to the condition:
$$x^2 - 1 = y^2 \implies x^2 - y^2 = 1$$
The locus $\Gamma$ is a standard hyperbola.

**2. Establish the Condition for Circle Center and Radius**
Let circle $C_i$ have center $(0, y_i)$ and radius $r_i$.
Substitute the hyperbola equation $x^2 = 1 + y^2$ into the circle equation $x^2 + (y-y_i)^2 = r_i^2$:
$$(1+y^2) + (y-y_i)^2 = r_i^2$$
$$2y^2 - 2y_iy + (1 + y_i^2 - r_i^2) = 0$$
For tangency, $\Delta = 0$:
$$4y_i^2 - 8(1 + y_i^2 - r_i^2) = 0 \implies y_i^2 = 2r_i^2 - 2$$
This implies $r_i \ge 1$. For $r_1 = 3$, $y_1 = \sqrt{18-2} = 4$. So $C_1$ is centered at $(0, 4)$.
**3. Analyze the Two Circles Relationship**
Circles $C_1, C_2$ are externally tangent at $P$ on the $y$-axis. The distance between centers is the sum of radii:
$$|y_1 - y_2| = r_1 + r_2$$
Substitute $y_i = \sqrt{2r_i^2 - 2}$ (since centers must be on the same side relative to origin for external tangency with the hyperbola branch structure, or verifying algebraic solutions):
$$|\sqrt{2r_2^2 - 2} - 4| = 3 + r_2$$
Solving for $r_2$:
Case A: $\sqrt{2r_2^2 - 2} - 4 = 3 + r_2 \implies \sqrt{2r_2^2 - 2} = r_2 + 7$. Squaring both sides leads to $r_2^2 - 14r_2 - 51 = 0 \implies (r_2-17)(r_2+3)=0$. Since $r_2>0$, **$r_2 = 17$**.
Case B: $4 - \sqrt{2r_2^2 - 2} = 3 + r_2 \implies 1 - r_2 = \sqrt{2r_2^2 - 2}$. Squaring leads to $1 - 2r_2 + r_2^2 = 2r_2^2 - 2 \implies r_2^2 + 2r_2 - 3 = 0 \implies (r_2+3)(r_2-1)=0$. Since $r_2>0$, **$r_2 = 1$**.

**4. Calculate $|\vec{PA}|^2$**
Let $P$ be at $(0, y_p)$. Since $P$ is the point of tangency between the circles:
$y_p = y_1 \pm r_1$. Also $A$ is $(1, 0)$.
$$|\vec{PA}|^2 = (1-0)^2 + (0-y_p)^2 = 1 + y_p^2$$

We derive the general relation. Since $P$ is the tangency point of two circles centered at $y_1, y_2$:
$y_p = \frac{y_1 r_2 + y_2 r_1}{r_1 + r_2}$ is not needed. Simpler approach:
From previous derivation, the tangency point $P$ satisfies $y_p^2 = r_1r_2 - 1 - 1 = r_1r_2 - 2$ is incorrect. Let's recalculate carefully.
From derivation step 3 in previous analysis: $y_p = \frac{r_2 - r_1}{2}$.
Then $|\vec{PA}|^2 = 1 + y_p^2 = 1 + (\frac{r_2 - r_1}{2})^2$.
*Correction*: Wait, let's re-verify the $y_p$ relation.
$y_1 = 4$.
If $r_2 = 17$, $y_2 = 24$. Since $y_1 < y_2$, $P$ is between them: $y_p = y_1 + r_1 = 4 + 3 = 7$.
If $r_2 = 1$, $y_2 = 0$. Since $y_2 < y_1$, $P$ is between them: $y_p = y_1 - r_1 = 4 - 3 = 1$.

Now calculate $|\vec{PA}|^2 = 1 + y_p^2$:
* **Scenario 1 ($r_2 = 17, y_p = 7$):**
    $|\vec{PA}|^2 = 1 + 7^2 = 50$.
* **Scenario 2 ($r_2 = 1, y_p = 1$):**
    $|\vec{PA}|^2 = 1 + 1^2 = 2$.

(Note: The formula $|\vec{PA}|^2 = r_1r_2 - 1$ derived in the previous iteration also holds: $3(17)-1=50$ and $3(1)-1=2$.)
