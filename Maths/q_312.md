Convergence of Non-linear Recurrence RelationsProblem Statement:Consider the sequence $\{x_n\}$ defined by the recurrence relation:$$x_{n+1} = 108 - \frac{815 - \frac{1500}{x_{n-1}}}{x_n}$$The initial values are set to $x_0 = 4$ and $x_1 = 4.24$.Determine the theoretical limit of the sequence, $L = \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n$, assuming the calculation is performed using infinite precision arithmetic.

## 解答
Standard Solution (Ground Truth)1. Fixed Point AnalysisFirst, assume the limit exists and let $L = \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n$. Substituting $L$ into the recurrence relation:$$L = 108 - \frac{815 - \frac{1500}{L}}{L}$$Multiplying by $L$ (assuming $L \neq 0$):$$L^2 = 108L - \left(815 - \frac{1500}{L}\right)$$Multiplying by $L$ again to clear the denominator:$$L^3 - 108L^2 + 815L - 1500 = 0$$We solve this cubic equation for the fixed points. Testing divisors of 1500, we find the roots are:$$L_1 = 100, \quad L_2 = 5, \quad L_3 = 3$$2. Linearization and Dominant Term AnalysisThe non-linear recurrence can be associated with a linear homogeneous recurrence relation. Let $x_n = \frac{y_{n+1}}{y_n}$. Substituting this into the original equation leads to the linear characteristic equation:$$r^3 - 108r^2 + 815r - 1500 = 0$$The roots are $r_1=100, r_2=5, r_3=3$. The general solution for the linear auxiliary sequence $y_n$ is:$$y_n = C_1(100)^n + C_2(5)^n + C_3(3)^n$$Thus, the behavior of $x_n$ is given by:$$x_n = \frac{y_{n+1}}{y_n} = \frac{C_1(100)^{n+1} + C_2(5)^{n+1} + C_3(3)^{n+1}}{C_1(100)^n + C_2(5)^n + C_3(3)^n}$$3. Determining the LimitAs $n \to \infty$, the term with the largest base will dominate the expression, provided its coefficient is non-zero.Dividing numerator and denominator by $100^n$:$$\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{100 C_1 + C_2(5/100)^n \cdot 5 + \dots}{C_1 + C_2(5/100)^n + \dots} = 100$$This limit holds true if and only if $C_1 \neq 0$.4. Initial Condition Check (The Trap)The coefficient $C_1$ is determined by the initial values $x_0$ and $x_1$.The specific ratio that results in $C_1 = 0$ (forcing the sequence to the intermediate root 5) is exactly $x_1/x_0 = 4.25/4$ (or $x_1 = 4.25$ when $x_0=4$).In this problem, the initial value is $x_1 = 4.24$. Since $4.24 \neq 4.25$, the initial state does not lie on the eigenvector corresponding to the root 5.Therefore, $C_1 \neq 0$.Conclusion:Although the sequence starts near 4 and 5, the presence of the non-zero $C_1$ term means that the $100^n$ component will eventually overwhelm the other terms. The theoretical limit is the largest root.Answer:$$100$$
