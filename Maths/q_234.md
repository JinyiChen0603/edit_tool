## 题目

In triangle $ABC$, we have $AB > AC$ and $\angle A = 60^\circ$. Let $O$ denote the circumcenter and $H$ denote the orthocenter. The perpendicular bisector of segment $OH$ intersects side $BC$ at point $D$, intersects $OB$ at point $F$, and intersects $OC$ at point $E$. Given that $DE = 4$ and $EF = 5$, find $\frac{AD}{AB}$.




## 解答

\item \textbf{Construct Auxiliary Lines.} Draw $BH$ intersecting $AC$ at point $G$, and construct $OK \perp AB$ with foot $K$. Connect $AO$ and $AH$. We have $AG = AK$, $\angle AOK = \angle ACB = \angle AHG$, and $\angle BOC = \angle BHC = 120^\circ$, which implies $\triangle AOK \cong \triangle AHG$. The line $DEF$ passes through point $A$, and $AD$ serves as the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$.

\item \textbf{Establish Proportional Relations.} Since $\angle DAC = \angle DCE = 30^\circ$, we have $\triangle CDE \sim \triangle ADC$. This yields $CD^2 = DE \cdot DA$. By similar reasoning, $BD^2 = DF \cdot DA$. Consequently,
\[ \frac{CD}{BD} = \sqrt{\frac{DE}{DE+EF}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}} = \frac{2}{3} = \frac{AC}{AB} \]

\item \textbf{Apply the Law of Cosines.} From $\frac{CD}{BD} = \frac{2}{3}$, we obtain: $\frac{AC}{AB} = \frac{2}{3}$

Using the Law of Cosines in $\triangle ABC$, the ratio of the three sides is:
\[ \frac{AC}{2} = \frac{AB}{3} = \frac{BC}{\sqrt{7}} \]

This gives us $\frac{AB}{BD} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{7}}$. Let $AB = 5t$ and $BD = \sqrt{7}t$. 

From $BD^2 = AD \cdot DF$, we obtain: $7t^2 = AD \cdot 9$, which yields $AD = \frac{7t^2}{9}$

Applying the Law of Cosines in $\triangle ADB$ and solving the resulting equation gives $t = \frac{18}{7}\sqrt{3}$

Note that the condition $AB > AD$ is satisfied.

Therefore,
\[ \frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{\frac{7t^2}{9}}{5t} =  10\sqrt{3} \]

## 答案
\[10\sqrt{3}\]
