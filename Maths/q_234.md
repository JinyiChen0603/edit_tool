## 题目
A surveyor maps a triangular plot of land defined by points $A$, $B$, and $C$, where the side length $AB$ is greater than $AC$ and the internal angle at $A$ measures $60^\circ$. The surveyor identifies the circumcenter $O$ (the center of the circle passing through all three vertices) and the orthocenter $H$ (the intersection point of the altitudes). A proposed property line is drawn as the perpendicular bisector of the segment $OH$. This line intersects the boundary $BC$ at point $D$, the radial segment $OB$ at point $F$, and the radial segment $OC$ at point $E$. If the measured distance between $D$ and $E$ is 4 units and the distance between $E$ and $F$ is 5 units, calculate the length of side $AC$.

## 解答
Construct an Auxiliary Line.
Connect $BH$, let it intersect $AC$ at $G$, and draw $OK \perp AB$ at $K$. Connect $AO$ and $AH$. Then $AG = AK$, $\angle AOK = \angle ACB = \angle AHG$, $\angle BOC = \angle BHC = 120^\circ$, so $\triangle AOK \cong \triangle AHG$. Line DEF passes through $A$, and $AD$ bisects $\angle BAC$.

Derive the Proportional Relationship.
Since $\angle DAC = \angle DCE = 30^\circ$, $\triangle CDE \sim \triangle ADC$. We have $CD^2 = DE \cdot DA$. Similarly, $BD^2 = DF \cdot DA$. Thus,
$$
\frac{CD}{BD} = \sqrt{\frac{DE}{DE+EF}} = \frac{2}{3} = \frac{AC}{AB}
$$

Calculate with the cosine rule.
Let $AC = 15x$, $AC = 10x$, since $\angle BAC = 60^\circ$, $BC = 5\sqrt{7}x$ and $DC = 2\sqrt{7}x$.
In $\triangle ADC$, $\angle DAC = 30^\circ$, solve the cosine rule equation
$$
49x^2 - 70\sqrt{3}x + 72 = 0
$$
Then we get $AC = \dfrac{4\sqrt{3}}{7}$.

## 答案
$$\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{7}$$
