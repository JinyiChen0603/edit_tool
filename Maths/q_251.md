## 题目
Eight chemical storage tanks, numbered $1,2,\ldots,8$, are positioned at eight equally spaced points on a circular pipeline.  
Let
\[
T=\sum_{i=1}^{8} (a_i-a_{i+1})^2
\]
denote the sum of the squares of the differences between the numbers of all adjacent tanks on the circle, where indices are taken modulo $8$.  

Arrangements that can be made to coincide by rotation are considered the same, while arrangements that coincide after reflection are considered different.  

Determine the probability that a random configuration of the tanks maximizes $T$.

## 解答
\textbf{Solution}

Place the tanks in a circular order $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_8$. As before,
\[
T=\sum_{i=1}^{8}(a_i-a_{i+1})^2
=2\sum_{i=1}^{8} a_i^2 - 2\sum_{i=1}^{8} a_i a_{i+1}.
\]
Since $\{a_i\}=\{1,2,\ldots,8\}$, the quantity $\sum a_i^2$ is fixed. Hence maximizing $T$ is equivalent to minimizing
\[
S=\sum_{i=1}^{8} a_i a_{i+1}.
\]

To minimize $S$, adjacent numbers should differ as much as possible. Because $8$ is even, the optimal arrangement alternates perfectly between large and small numbers. Thus the set of large numbers $\{5,6,7,8\}$ alternates with the set of small numbers $\{1,2,3,4\}$ around the circle.

Up to rotation, there are exactly two such alternating arrangements:
\[
1,8,2,7,3,6,4,5 \quad \text{and its reflection}.
\]
Both achieve the same minimum value of $S$, and hence the same maximum value of $T$.

Therefore, the number of configurations that maximize $T$ is $2$.

\medskip

The total number of distinct circular arrangements up to rotation is
\[
\frac{8!}{8}=7!=5040.
\]

\medskip

\textbf{Probability}

Hence, the probability that a randomly chosen configuration maximizes $T$ is
\[
\boxed{\frac{2}{7!}=\frac{1}{2520}}.
\]

## 答案
$\frac{1}{2520}$
