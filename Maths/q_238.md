## 题目
Problem Background: On an ideal flat billiard table, the motion of the ball follows the principle of “specular reflection,” that is, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection when the ball hits the edge of the table. Consider a regular hexagonal billiard table $ABCDEF$ with side length $a$. Given Conditions: (1) Initial Position: A ball is struck from the midpoint $M$ of side $AB$. (2) Motion Path: The initial direction of motion makes an angle $\theta$ with side $AB$ (i.e., $\angle BMQ=\theta$). The ball successively collides with sides $BC, CD, DE, EF, FA$, and finally returns to the initial side $AB$. (3) Collision Constraint: The point of impact on each side must be strictly inside that side (excluding the vertices). Problem to Solve: To ensure that the ball strictly collides with these five sides in the order described above, and finally returns to side $AB$, determine the range of possible values for the initial angle of projection $\theta$.

## 解答
Let the side length of the regular hexagon be $a$. The ball starts from the midpoint $P$ of $AB$, and the incidence satisfies the condition that “the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection”. Unfolding (Symmetry) Method: successively reflect the regular hexagon across the sides $BC, CD, DE, EF, FA$ that are struck (5 times in total). Then the broken line path on the table, after reflection, corresponds to a straight line in the unfolded plane, starting from $P$ and passing through these mirrored hexagons, finally reaching a mirrored $AB$. To ensure that each collision point falls inside the corresponding side (not on the vertices), this straight line in the unfolded diagram must lie within the open angle formed by two “critical rays”: the critical rays pass through the corresponding two extreme vertices in the unfolded diagram (once the line goes beyond these rays, it will hit the endpoint of a collision side, thus violating the problem conditions). Establishing Coordinates: take $P$ as the origin, and let $PB$ be the positive $x$-axis. Then $\theta$ is the angle between the ray $PQ$ and the $x$-axis. In the unfolded diagram, the two critical rays pass through the points $M\bigl(4a,\tfrac{3\sqrt3}{2}a\bigr)$ and $N\bigl(5a,\tfrac{3\sqrt3}{2}a\bigr)$. Therefore, the critical slopes are $\tan\angle MPB=\dfrac{\frac{3\sqrt3}{2}a}{4a}=\dfrac{3\sqrt3}{8}$ and $\tan\angle NPB=\dfrac{\frac{3\sqrt3}{2}a}{5a}=\dfrac{3\sqrt3}{10}$. To ensure that each collision point is strictly within the side, an open interval should be used (the endpoints correspond to hitting the vertices): $\arctan\dfrac{3\sqrt3}{10}<\theta<\arctan\dfrac{3\sqrt3}{8}$.

## 答案
$\arctan\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{10} < \theta < \arctan\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}$
