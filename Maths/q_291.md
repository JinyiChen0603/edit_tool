## 题目
Calculate the maximum integer $k$ such that a set of $k$ distinct numbers can be chosen from $\{1, 2, \dots, 1988\}$, where the difference between any pair of chosen numbers is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3.

## 解答
The maximum value of $k$ is 663. First, we prove that $k \le 663$. We note the following fact: when $x - y = 1$ or $2$, we have $x - y \mid x + y$. From this, we know that for any two numbers $x,y$ taken from three consecutive natural numbers, we must have $x - y \mid x + y$. When $k > 663$, let $A_i = \{3i - 2,3i - 1,3i\}\ (i = 1,2,\dots,662)$, $A_{663} = \{1987,1988\}$. We assign the selected $k \ge 664$ numbers to these 663 sets. At least one set contains two numbers $x,y$ from them, and obviously $x - y \mid x + y$, which is a contradiction. Next, when $k = 663$, let $A = \{1,4,7,\dots,1987\}$. For any two numbers $a_i,a_j$ in $A$, we have $a_i-a_j = (3i-2)-(3j-2) = 3(i-j)$, and $a_i + a_j = (3i - 2) + (3j - 2) = 3(i + j - 1) - 1$. Therefore, $a_i - a_j$ does not divide $a_i + a_j$.

Note: This solution is incorrect. The problem requires that the difference between any pair is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3. This means the difference must be congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. It can be proven that any set satisfying this condition can contain at most 2 elements.

663
