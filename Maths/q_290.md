## 题目
A structural engineer is analyzing a triangular steel frame ABC where the beam lengths are ( AB = $\sqrt{30}$ ) meters, ( AC = $\sqrt{6}$ ) meters, and ( BC = $\sqrt{15}$ ) meters. A support column is installed at point D such that AD passes through the midpoint of BC, and the angle ADB measures exactly 90 degrees. Calculate the ratio of the area of triangle ADB to the area of triangle ABC, express this ratio in the form ( $\frac{m}{n}$ ) where m and n are relatively prime positive integers, and determine the sum ( $m + n$ ).

## 解答
Let $E$ be the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$. Since $BE = EC$, then $\triangle ABE$ and $\triangle AEC$ share the same height and have equal bases, and thus have the same area. Similarly, $\triangle BDE$ and $\triangle BAE$ share the same height, and have bases in the ratio $DE : AE$, so $\frac{[BDE]}{[BAE]} = \frac{DE}{AE}$ (see area ratios).
Now,
$$
\frac{[ADB]}{[ABC]} = \frac{[ABE] + [BDE]}{2[ABE]} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{DE}{2AE}.
$$
By Stewart's Theorem, 
$$
AE = \frac{\sqrt{2(AB^2 + AC^2) - BC^2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{57}}{2},
$$
and by the Pythagorean Theorem on $ \triangle ABD $, $ \triangle EBD $,
$$
BD^2 + \left(DE + \frac{\sqrt{57}}{2}\right)^2 = 30
$$
$$
BD^2 + DE^2 = \frac{15}{4}
$$
Subtracting the two equations yields 
$$
DE\sqrt{57} + \frac{57}{4} = \frac{105}{4} \implies DE = \frac{12}{\sqrt{57}}.
$$
Then 
$$
\frac{m}{n} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{DE}{2AE} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\frac{12}{\sqrt{57}}}{2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{57}}{2}} = \frac{27}{38}
$$
and $m+n = 065$.
