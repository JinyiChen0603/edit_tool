## 题目
An engineer is tasked with constructing a three-tier tower using no more than $1988$ unit cubes. The structure consists of three square-based right prisms A, B, and C, each with a height of $1$ and integer base side lengths $a, b$, and $c$, respectively. To ensure structural stability, the following constraints must be met:
Size Hierarchy: $a < b < c$
Edge Clearance: Each prism's base must sit entirely within the boundary of the prism below it, with a minimum clearance of at least 1 unit on all sides (i.e., $b \ge a+2$ and $c \ge b+2$).
Given that there are $N$ distinct valid triplets $(a, b, c)$ satisfying these conditions, calculate the exact value of $N$.

## 解答
Problem Analysis
The problem asks for the maximum number of unit cubes used to build a three-tier tower, where the total volume $V$ is the sum of the capacities of three square-based prisms $A, B,$ and $C$ with heights of 1 and integer base sides $a, b,$ and $c$. The governing equation is:
$$ V = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \quad \text{subject to} \quad V \leq 1988, \quad a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}^+ $$

Mathematical Derivation
1. Existence Proof via Number Theory
According to Legendre's three-square theorem, a positive integer $n$ can be expressed as the sum of three squares if and only if $n$ is not of the form $4^k(8m + 7)$. For $n = 1988$:
$$ 1988 = 4 \times 497 $$
Checking $497 \pmod 8$:
$$ 497 \equiv 1 \pmod 8 $$
Since $497$ is not of the form $8m + 7$, the number $1988$ can indeed be represented as the sum of three integer squares.

2. Finding the Optimal Solution
To maximize $V$, we check if $V=1988$ is achievable with distinct or hierarchical integers (typically $a > b > c$). We search for squares near the boundary $\sqrt{1988} \approx 44.58$:
- Let $a = 40$, then $a^2 = 1600$.
- Remaining value: $1988 - 1600 = 388$.
- Let $b = 18$, then $b^2 = 324$.
- Remaining value: $388 - 324 = 64$, which is $8^2$.

Thus, $(a, b, c) = (40, 18, 8)$ is a valid integer solution set.

Conclusion
The maximum total number of cubes used while satisfying the constraints is:
$$ \bm{V_{\max} = 1988} $$

## 答案
$1988$
