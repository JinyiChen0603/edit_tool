## 题目
An astronomer observes three celestial bodies $A$, $B$, and $C$ that lie on a great circle of the celestial sphere. From an observation point $D$, the lines of sight to bodies $B$ and $C$ are tangent to this great circle. A reference star $G$ lies on the line of sight extending from $D$ through $B$. The measured angles are $\angle GAB = \angle BAD = \alpha$ and $\angle ADB = \beta$. Determine the value of the ratio $\frac{DA}{DG}\frac{BC}{AC}$ as a function of $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

## 解答
AD and AG intersect the circle at E and F, respectively. Then
$$\angle DBE = \alpha = \angle BEF = \angle BFE,$$
so $EF \parallel DG$ and $BE = BF$.
$$EF = 2BE \times \cos\alpha.$$
$$\frac{DA}{DG} = \frac{EA}{EF} = \frac{EA}{2BE\cos\alpha}.$$
By Ptolemy's theorem and the Power of a Point theorem,
$$EA \times BC = 2BE \times AC,$$
so
$$\frac{DA}{DG} = \frac{AC}{BC\cos\alpha}.$$
$$\frac{DA}{DG}\frac{BC}{AC}=\frac{1}{\cos \alpha}$$

## 答案
$\frac{1}{\cos \alpha}$
