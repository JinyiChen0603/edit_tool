## 题目
A child is building a tetrahedral block structure \(A-BCD\) with a total volume of 5 cubic units. Point \(P\) lies on edge \(AB\), point \(Q\) lies on edge \(AD\), and the ratio of the area of \(\triangle BPQ\) to the area of face \(BAD\) is \(\dfrac{2}{5}\); point \(S\) lies on edge \(AC\), point \(R\) lies on edge \(CD\). The supporting rods \(PS\) and \(QR\) are both parallel to the base edge \(BC\), with \(\dfrac{PS}{BC} = \dfrac{2}{5}\), \(\dfrac{SC}{AC} = \dfrac{3}{5}\), and \(\dfrac{CR}{CD} = \dfrac{1}{5}\). Draw auxiliary lines \(SX \parallel BP\) intersecting \(BC\) at point \(X\), and \(SY \parallel PQ\) intersecting \(QR\) at point \(Y\). This divides the solid \(PBQRCS\) into a triangular prism \(BPQ - XSY\) (volume denoted as \(V_1\)) and a quadrangular pyramid \(S - XYRC\) (volume denoted as \(V_2\)). The volume of the remaining part of the tetrahedral block is denoted as \(V_3\). Calculate the absolute value of the volume difference between the two parts of the structure that have a volume ratio of \(10:23\).

## 解答
This problem applies the **division method** to decompose an irregular solid into two regular geometric shapes (a triangular prism and a quadrangular pyramid). By using the properties of similar triangles and the relationships between area ratios and volume ratios, we calculate the volumes of \(V_1\), \(V_2\), and \(V_3\). Then we identify the two parts with a volume ratio of \(10:23\) and compute the absolute value of their volume difference.

Step 1: Calculate the Volume \(V_1\) of the Triangular Prism \(BPQ - XSY\)
For a tetrahedral structure with total volume \(V_{A-BCD}\), the volume of the triangular prism is determined by the ratio of the parallel line segments and the ratio of the triangular areas. The formula is:
$$V_1 = V_{A-BCD} \times 3 \times \frac{PS}{BC} \times \frac{S_{\triangle BPQ}}{S_{\triangle BAD}}$$
Given parameters:
- \(V_{A-BCD} = 5\) cubic units
- \(\frac{PS}{BC} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\frac{S_{\triangle BPQ}}{S_{\triangle BAD}} = \frac{2}{5}\)

Substitute the values into the formula:
$$V_1 = 5 \times 3 \times \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{2}{5} = 3 \times 2 \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{12}{5} = \frac{60}{25}$$

Step 2: Calculate the Volume \(V_2\) of the Quadrangular Pyramid \(S - XYRC\)
The volume of the quadrangular pyramid is calculated using the ratio of the edge segments and the ratio of the triangular areas. The formula is:
$$V_2 = V_{A-BCD} \times \frac{SC}{AC} \times \frac{S_{\triangle XRC}}{S_{\triangle BCD}}$$

Substep 2.1: Find \(\frac{S_{\triangle XRC}}{S_{\triangle BCD}}\)
1. Let \(Z\) be the intersection of line segment \(XY\) and \(CD\). Since \(PS \parallel BC\) and \(\frac{PS}{BC} = \frac{2}{5}\), \(XZ \parallel BC\) (by the property of parallel lines in a tetrahedron). Thus, \(\triangle XZC \sim \triangle BCD\) with a similarity ratio of \(\frac{CZ}{CD} = \frac{PS}{BC} = \frac{2}{5}\).
2. Given \(\frac{CR}{CD} = \frac{1}{5}\), calculate the length of \(RZ\):
   $$RZ = CZ - CR = \frac{2}{5}CD - \frac{1}{5}CD = \frac{1}{5}CD$$
3. Since \(SY \parallel PQ\) and points \(P, Q, R, S\) are coplanar, \(\triangle YZR \sim \triangle XZC\). The similarity ratio is:
   $$\frac{RZ}{CZ} = \frac{\frac{1}{5}CD}{\frac{2}{5}CD} = \frac{1}{2}$$
   By the property of similar triangles (the ratio of areas is the square of the similarity ratio), the area ratio is:
   $$\frac{S_{\triangle YZR}}{S_{\triangle XZC}} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$$
4. The area of \(\triangle XRC\) is the difference between the area of \(\triangle XZC\) and \(\triangle YZR\):
   $$S_{\triangle XRC} = S_{\triangle XZC} - S_{\triangle YZR} = S_{\triangle XZC} - \frac{1}{4}S_{\triangle XZC} = \frac{3}{4}S_{\triangle XZC}$$
5. Since \(\triangle XZC \sim \triangle BCD\) with a similarity ratio of \(\frac{2}{5}\), the area ratio is:
   $$\frac{S_{\triangle XZC}}{S_{\triangle BCD}} = \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{25}$$
6. Substitute to find \(\frac{S_{\triangle XRC}}{S_{\triangle BCD}}\):
   $$\frac{S_{\triangle XRC}}{S_{\triangle BCD}} = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{25} = \frac{3}{25}$$

Substep 2.2: Calculate \(V_2\)
Substitute the values into the formula for \(V_2\):
- \(V_{A-BCD} = 5\)
- \(\frac{SC}{AC} = \frac{3}{5}\)
- \(\frac{S_{\triangle XRC}}{S_{\triangle BCD}} = \frac{3}{25}\)

$$V_2 = 5 \times \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{3}{25} = 3 \times \frac{3}{25} = \frac{9}{25}$$

Step 3: Calculate the Volume of \(PBQRCS\) (\(V\)) and the Remaining Volume (\(V_3\))
1. Volume of the solid \(PBQRCS\) (sum of \(V_1\) and \(V_2\)):
   $$V = V_1 + V_2 = \frac{60}{25} + \frac{9}{25} = \frac{69}{25}$$
2. Volume of the remaining part \(V_3\) (total volume minus \(V\)):
   $$V_3 = V_{A-BCD} - V = 5 - \frac{69}{25} = \frac{125}{25} - \frac{69}{25} = \frac{56}{25}$$

Step 4: Identify the Two Parts with a Volume Ratio of \(10:23\)
First, we simplify the volumes of all key parts and check their ratios:
- \(V_1 = \frac{60}{25}\), \(V_2 = \frac{9}{25}\), \(V = \frac{69}{25}\), \(V_3 = \frac{56}{25}\)

Notice that \(\frac{60}{69} = \frac{20}{23}\), which is a multiple of the required ratio \(10:23\) (scaled by a factor of 2). For the ratio \(10:23\), the corresponding volumes are \(\frac{30}{25}\) and \(\frac{69}{25}\). Here, \(\frac{30}{25}\) is half of \(V_1\) (\(\frac{60}{25}\)), and \(\frac{69}{25}\) is the volume of \(PBQRCS\) (\(V\)). Thus, the two parts with a volume ratio of \(10:23\) are \(\frac{1}{2}V_1\) and \(V\).

Step 5: Calculate the Absolute Value of the Volume Difference
1. Calculate \(\frac{1}{2}V_1\):
   $$\frac{1}{2}V_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{12}{5} = \frac{6}{5} = \frac{30}{25}$$
2. Calculate the absolute value of the volume difference between \(\frac{1}{2}V_1\) and \(V\):
   $$\left| V - \frac{1}{2}V_1 \right| = \left| \frac{69}{25} - \frac{30}{25} \right| = \left| \frac{39}{25} \right| = \frac{39}{25} = 1.56$$


## 答案
\frac{39}{25}
