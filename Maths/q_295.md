## 题目
An agricultural engineer has $3988$ meters of fencing material to be used solely for internal fencing, dividing the field into congruent square test plots. The entire field must be divided into squares, and the sides of the squares must be parallel to the edges of the field. A rectangular research field measures $48$ meters by $104$ meters. Determine the largest possible number of square test plots into which the field can be partitioned, using all or part of the $3988$ meters of fence.

## 解答
### 1. Setting Variables and Relationships  
Suppose there are $n$ squares in each column of the grid and $m$ squares in each row. According to the length - width ratio of the rectangle (104:48):  
- $m=\frac{104}{48}n = \frac{13}{6}n$  
- Since $m$ must be an integer, $n$ must be a multiple of 6 (i.e., $6\mid n$).  
### 2. Calculating the Total Length of Internal Fences  
- Vertical fences: length 48, quantity $m - 1=\frac{13}{6}n - 1$.  
- Horizontal fences: length 104, quantity $n - 1$.  
The formula for the total length is:  
$$48\left(\frac{13}{6}n - 1\right) + 104(n - 1) \le 3988$$  
### 3. Solving the Inequality for $n$  
Expand and simplify the equation:  
$$8\times 13 n - 48 + 104 n - 104 \le 3988$$  
### 4. Determining the Maximum Value  
- According to the inequality, the maximum integer value of $n$ is 19.  
- Since $n$ must be a multiple of 6, the largest integer that satisfies the condition is $n = 18$.  
### 5. Calculating the Final Result (Total Number of Squares)  
The total number of squares is equal to the number of rows multiplied by the number of columns:  
$$ \text{Total}=n\times m=n\times\left(\frac{13}{6}n\right)=\frac{13}{6}n^{2} $$  
$$ \frac{13}{6}\times18^{2}=\frac{13}{6}\times324 = 13\times54 = 702 $$

## 答案
702
