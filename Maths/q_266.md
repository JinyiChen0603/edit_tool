## 题目
The Galactic Federation consists of a central hub station, "Prime Core," and 2,010 remote colony worlds. Currently, every single colony world has a direct, active Hyperlane connection to Prime Core.

The network topology follows these specific structural laws:

Connection Limit: Each of the 2,010 colony worlds has a total number of active Hyperlane connections (counting the link to Prime Core and any links to other colonies) that is strictly less than 2,010.
The Parity Rule: If any two colony worlds have the exact same total number of active connections, that number must be an even integer.
Due to an energy crisis, the Federation engineers need to shut down as many direct Hyperlanes to Prime Core as possible to save power. However, the network must remain connected (meaning every colony can still reach Prime Core, possibly routing through other colonies).

Question:
Find the maximum number, $k$, of direct Hyperlanes connected to Prime Core that can be shut down, such that the network remains fully connected regardless of how the inter-colony links are arranged.

- Local cap on laboratories. For every laboratory $L_i$, its degree in the entire graph satisfies
$$
\deg(L_i) < 2010.
$$

- Parity-shadow consistency. If two distinct vertices $u\neq v$ in $G$ have equal degree, then this common degree must be even; i.e.
if $\deg(u)=\deg(v)$, then $\deg(u)$ is even.

A scheduled maintenance window requires disabling some uplinks incident to the Core $C$. The operator is allowed to choose which uplinks to disable after the full network $G$ is known.
Determine the largest integer $k$ such that for every graph $G$ satisfying conditions (1)–(3), there always exists a set of exactly $k$ edges among $\{(C,L_1),(C,L_2),\dots,(C,L_{2010})\}$ whose removal leaves the resulting graph connected (equivalently, every vertex remains reachable from $C$).

## 解答

The maximum number of Hyperlanes that can be shut down is $k = 503$.

Proof and Derivation
1. Graph Theoretic Formulation
Let the network be represented by a graph $G = (V, E)$.

Let $v_0$ represent the Prime Core.
Let $V' = {v_1, v_2, \dots, v_{2010}}$ represent the 2,010 colony worlds.
The total vertex set is $V = {v_0} \cup V'$.
Initially, for every $v_i \in V'$, there exists an edge $(v_0, v_i)$. Thus, $\deg(v_0) = 2010$.

Let $d(v)$ denote the degree of vertex $v$ in graph $G$. The problem states two conditions:

$d(v_i) < 2010$ for all $v_i \in V'$.
If $d(v_i) = d(v_j)$ for $i \neq j$, then $d(v_i)$ is even. Equivalently, all vertices with odd degrees must have distinct degrees.

2. Analysis of Odd-Degree Vertices
First, we determine the maximum possible number of vertices in $V'$ that have an odd degree.
The possible odd degrees strictly less than 2010 are ${1, 3, 5, \dots, 2009}$.
The number of such values is:
$$ \frac{2009 - 1}{2} + 1 = 1005 $$
However, by the Handshaking Lemma, the number of vertices with odd degrees in any finite graph must be even.
Therefore, the number of odd-degree vertices in $V'$, denoted as $N_{odd}$, cannot be 1,005. It must be at most:
$$ N_{odd} \le 1004 $$
3. Connectivity and Component Analysis
We are looking for the maximum $k$ such that removing $k$ edges incident to $v_0$ preserves connectivity. This is equivalent to finding the minimum number of edges incident to $v_0$ required to maintain connectivity in the worst-case graph topology.
Let us remove $v_0$ from the graph. The remaining subgraph induced by $V'$ will partition into $m$ connected components, denoted $C_1, C_2, \dots, C_m$.
To ensure the entire graph $G$ remains connected, we must retain at least one edge between $v_0$ and each component $C_j$.
Thus, the number of edges we must keep is at least $m$.
Consequently, the number of edges we can remove is $k = 2010 - m$.
To find the "safe" maximum $k$, we must find the maximum possible value of $m$ (the worst-case fragmentation).
4. Classifying Components
In the original graph $G$, let $e(C_j)$ be the number of edges connecting the component $C_j$ to $v_0$.
We classify the components into two types:

Type A: $e(C_j) = 1$. (Connected to Prime Core by exactly 1 edge).
Type B: $e(C_j) \ge 2$. (Connected to Prime Core by 2 or more edges).

Lemma: Every Type A component must contain at least one vertex $v \in V'$ such that $d(v)$ is odd in $G$.
Proof of Lemma:
Consider a Type A component $C_j$. Let $E_{internal}$ be the edges entirely within $C_j$.
The sum of the degrees of the vertices in $C_j$ (measured in $G$) is:
$$ \sum_{v \in C_j} d(v) = 2|E_{internal}| + e(C_j) $$
Since $e(C_j) = 1$ for Type A:
$$ \sum_{v \in C_j} d(v) = 2|E_{internal}| + 1 $$
Since $2|E_{internal}|$ is even, the sum $\sum d(v)$ is odd. For a sum of integers to be odd, at least one term in the sum must be odd. Therefore, there exists at least one vertex in $C_j$ with an odd degree.
5. Maximizing the Number of Components ($m$)
Let $x$ be the number of Type A components and $y$ be the number of Type B components.
The total number of components is $m = x + y$.
We have two constraints:

Odd Degree Constraint: Since each Type A component consumes at least one "odd degree slot," and there are at most 1,004 odd-degree vertices:
$$ x \le 1004 $$
Edge Count Constraint: The sum of edges connecting these components to $v_0$ is 2010.
$$ 1 \cdot x + \sum_{j=1}^{y} e(C_{B_j}) = 2010 $$
Since Type B components have at least 2 edges ($e(C_{B_j}) \ge 2$):
$$ x + 2y \le 2010 $$

To maximize $m = x + y$, we should maximize $x$ (since Type A components are "cheaper" in terms of edge usage).
Set $x$ to its maximum possible value:
$$ x = 1004 $$
Substitute $x$ into the edge constraint:
$$ 1004 + 2y \le 2010 $$
$$ 2y \le 1006 $$
$$ y \le 503 $$
Thus, the maximum number of components is:
$$ m_{max} = 1004 + 503 = 1507 $$
6. Conclusion
In the worst-case scenario, the network is fragmented into 1,507 components when $v_0$ is removed. To keep the network connected, we must keep 1 edge for each component.

Edges to keep: $1507$
Edges to remove ($k$):
$$ k = 2010 - 1507 = 503 $$

Therefore, the maximum number of Hyperlanes that can be safely shut down is 503.

## 答案
$$503$$
