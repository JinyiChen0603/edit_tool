## 题目
Let planar vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ satisfy
\[
|\mathbf{a}| = 3,\quad |\mathbf{b}| = 4,\quad \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} = 6.
\]
A triangle is constructed whose side lengths are
\[
|\mathbf{a}|,\quad |\mathbf{b}|,\quad |\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}|.
\]
A circle of radius $r$ is placed arbitrarily in the plane.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Determine the exact shape of the triangle.
\item[(b)] Find the maximum possible number of intersection points between the boundary of the triangle and the circle as a function of $r$.
\item[(c)] For which values of $r$ is this maximum attained?
\end{enumerate}


## 解答
\textbf{Solution.}

\textbf{(a) Shape of the triangle.}

By the law of cosines,
\[
|\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}|^2
= |\mathbf{a}|^2 + |\mathbf{b}|^2 - 2\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}
= 3^2 + 4^2 - 2\cdot 6
= 13.
\]
Hence,
\[
|\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}| = \sqrt{13}.
\]

Since
\[
3^2 + (\sqrt{13})^2 = 9 + 13 = 22 > 16 = 4^2,
\]
the triangle is an \emph{acute scalene triangle} with side lengths
\[
3,\quad 4,\quad \sqrt{13}.
\]

\textbf{(b) Maximum number of intersection points.}

Each side of the triangle is a line segment. A circle can intersect a line segment in at most $2$ points. Since the triangle has $3$ sides, the theoretical upper bound is
\[
2 \times 3 = 6.
\]

We now show this bound is achievable.

Because the triangle is acute, there exists a point strictly inside the triangle whose distance to each side is less than the altitude to that side. For sufficiently small $r$, the circle does not intersect any side. As $r$ increases, the circle may intersect each side in two points provided:
\begin{itemize}
\item the perpendicular distance from the circle’s center to each side is less than $r$,
\item and the projection point lies within the segment.
\end{itemize}

Since the triangle is acute, it is possible to place the circle’s center near the orthocenter so that these conditions hold simultaneously for all three sides.

Hence, the maximum possible number of intersection points is
\[
\boxed{6}.
\]

\textbf{(c) Values of $r$ for which the maximum is attained.}

Let $h_{\min}$ denote the smallest altitude of the triangle. Then:
\[
0 < r < h_{\min}
\]
is necessary for the circle to intersect all three sides in two points.

If $r = h_{\min}$, the circle is tangent to one side and intersects the other two in two points each, yielding $5$ intersections.  
If $r > h_{\min}$, at least one side has fewer than two intersection points.

Therefore, the maximum number $6$ is attained precisely when
\[
\boxed{0 < r < h_{\min}}.
\]

\hfill $\square$
