## 题目
An ecological park plans to arrange 5 vegetation observation points (numbered $A, B, C, D, E$) by a circular lake.
Constraints: The design elevations of the 5 observation points relative to the baseline are $a, b, c, d, e$, respectively. Due to the total terrain volume limitation, the sum of the elevations must be 5. To ensure drainage safety, the minimum elevation of each point must not be lower than -1 (i.e., a maximum allowed subsidence of 1 meter).
Objective: The landscape aesthetic score $S$ is defined as the product of the "sums of the elevations of two adjacent observation points": $$S = (a + b)(b + c)(c + d)(d + e)(e + a)$$
Please calculate the maximum and minimum values of the landscape aesthetic score $S$ for the park.

## 解答
Solution First, we find the minimum value of $S$, which only requires considering the case where $S < 0$.
(1) If among $a+b$, $b+c$, $c+d$, $d+e$, $e+a$, there are four positive and one negative, by symmetry, we may assume $a+b < 0$. Noting that $a+b+c+d+e = 5$ and $a+b \ge -2$, by the Arithmetic Mean Inequality, we have
$$
(b+c)(c+d)(d+e)(e+a) \leq \left[ \frac{(b+c) + (c+d) + (d+e) + (e+a)}{4} \right]^4
$$
$$
= \left( \frac{10 - a - b}{4} \right)^4 \leq 3^4 = 81,
$$
Thus, $S \ge -2 \times 81 = -162$.
(2) If among $a+b$, $b+c$, $c+d$, $d+e$, $e+a$, there are two positive and three negative, since
$$
-2 \leq a+b = 5 - c - d - e \leq 8,
$$
Similarly, we have $-2 \leq b+c, c+d, d+e, e+a \leq 8$, so in this case $S \ge (-2)^3 \times 8^2 = -512$.
(3) If $a+b$, $b+c$, $c+d$, $d+e$, $e+a$ are all negative, then $a+b+c+d+e < 0$, which is a contradiction! Therefore, this case cannot occur.
In summary, $S \ge -512$. When $a = b = c = d = -1$ and $e = 9$, $S$ attains its minimum value of $-512$.
Next, we find the maximum value of $S$, which only requires considering the case where $S > 0$.
(1) If $a+b$, $b+c$, $c+d$, $d+e$, $e+a$ are all positive, by the Arithmetic Mean Inequality, we have
$$
S \leq \left[ \frac{(a+b) + (b+c) + (c+d) + (d+e) + (e+a)}{5} \right]^5 = 32.
$$
(2) If among $a+b$, $b+c$, $c+d$, $d+e$, $e+a$, there are three positive and two negative, by symmetry, we only need to consider the following two cases:
① $a+b$, $b+c < 0$ and $c+d$, $d+e$, $e+a > 0$. In this case, we have
$$-2 \leq a+b < 0, \quad -2 \leq b+c < 0, \quad 0 < d+e \leq 8,$$
$$
0 < (c+d)(e+a) \leq \left( \frac{c+d+e+a}{2} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 \leq 9,
$$
Thus, $S \le (-2) \times (-2) \times 8 \times 9 = 288$.
② $a+b$, $c+d < 0$ and $b+c$, $d+e$, $e+a > 0$. In this case, noting that
$$ e = 5 - a - b - c - d \leq 7 - b - c < 7, $$
by the Arithmetic Mean Inequality, we have
$$
S \leq \left[ \frac{(-a - b) + (b + c) + (-c - d) + (d + e) + (e + a)}{5} \right]^5
$$
$$
= \left( \frac{2e}{5} \right)^2 < 3^5 < 288.
$$
(3) If among $a+b$, $b+c$, $c+d$, $d+e$, $e+a$, there is one positive and four negative, by symmetry, we may assume $a+b > 0$, then
$$ 0 > (b+c) + (c+d) + (e+a) = 5 + c \geq 4, $$
which is a contradiction! Therefore, this case will not occur.
In summary, $S \le 288$. When $a = b = c = -1$ and $d = e = 4$, $S$ attains its maximum value of $288$.

## 答案
$$-512, 288$$
