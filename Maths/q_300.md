## 题目
Subject: Optimization in Cyclic NetworksProblem Statement:A theoretical hexagon structure has 6 nodes with assigned values $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6$ arranged in a cycle.The system must satisfy the following constraints:Total Value Constraint: The sum of all node values is 6, i.e., $\sum_{i=1}^{6} x_i = 6$.Lower Bound Constraint: Each node value must be no less than -1, i.e., $x_i \ge -1$ for all $i$.Let $S$ be the "Cyclic Adjacent Product" defined as:$$S = (x_1 + x_2)(x_2 + x_3)(x_3 + x_4)(x_4 + x_5)(x_5 + x_6)(x_6 + x_1)$$Determine the maximum and minimum values of $S$.

## 解答
(Solution)Let $y_i = x_i + x_{i+1}$ for $i=1, \dots, 5$, and $y_6 = x_6 + x_1$. The expression becomes $S = y_1 y_2 y_3 y_4 y_5 y_6$.From the constraints on $x_i$, we derive the properties of $y_i$:Sum Constraint: $\sum_{i=1}^6 y_i = 2 \sum_{i=1}^6 x_i = 12$.Range Constraint: Since $x_i \ge -1$, $y_i \ge -2$.Parity Constraint (Key Step):$$\sum_{i=1}^6 (-1)^{i-1} y_i = (x_1+x_2) - (x_2+x_3) + \dots - (x_6+x_1) = 0$$$$\implies (y_1 + y_3 + y_5) - (y_2 + y_4 + y_6) = 0$$Combined with $\sum y_i = 12$, we determine that the sum of terms in odd positions and even positions must be equal:$$y_1 + y_3 + y_5 = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad y_2 + y_4 + y_6 = 6$$Let $P_{odd} = y_1 y_3 y_5$ and $P_{even} = y_2 y_4 y_6$. Then $S = P_{odd} \cdot P_{even}$.The problem reduces to finding the range of the product of three numbers $a, b, c$ such that $a+b+c=6$ and $a,b,c \ge -2$. Let's analyze the extrema of such a product $P = abc$:Case 1: Maximizing $P$ (Positive)If $a,b,c > 0$: By AM-GM inequality, $abc \le (\frac{6}{3})^3 = 8$.If two are negative (e.g., $a, b < 0$): To maximize $P$, we minimize the negative terms. The lowest value is -2. Let $a=b=-2$, then $c = 6 - (-4) = 10$.$P = (-2)(-2)(10) = 40$.Thus, the maximum possible value for $P_{odd}$ or $P_{even}$ is 40.Case 2: Minimizing $P$ (Negative)We need an odd number of negative terms. Since sum is 6 (positive), we cannot have 3 negative terms. We must have exactly 1 negative term.Let $a < 0$. To minimize $P$ (maximize $|P|$), we set $a$ to its lowest limit, $a = -2$.Then $b+c = 8$. We maximize $bc$ to make the total product most negative. Max $bc$ occurs at $b=c=4$.$P = (-2)(4)(4) = -32$.Thus, the minimum possible value for $P_{odd}$ or $P_{even}$ is -32.Calculation of Global Extrema for $S$:1. Maximum Value of $S$:To maximize $S$, $P_{odd}$ and $P_{even}$ must have the same sign and maximal magnitude.Both positive: We choose the configuration yielding 40 for both.$S_{max} = 40 \times 40 = 1600$.Construction: $y_{odd} = \{-2, -2, 10\}$, $y_{even} = \{-2, -2, 10\}$.Sequence $y$: $-2, -2, -2, -2, 10, 10$.Solving for $x$: $x_1=-1, x_2=-1, x_3=-1, x_4=-1, x_5=-1, x_6=11$. (Valid).2. Minimum Value of $S$:To minimize $S$, $P_{odd}$ and $P_{even}$ must have opposite signs and maximal magnitude.Let $P_{odd} = 40$ (Max Positive) and $P_{even} = -32$ (Min Negative).$S_{min} = 40 \times (-32) = -1280$.Construction: $y_{odd} = \{-2, -2, 10\}$, $y_{even} = \{-2, 4, 4\}$.Sequence $y$: $-2, -2, -2, 4, 10, 4$.Solving for $x$: $x_1=-1, x_2=-1, x_3=-1, x_4=-1, x_5=5, x_6=5$. (Valid).Conclusion:The maximum value is $1600$ and the minimum value is $-1280$.
