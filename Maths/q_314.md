## 题目
A small ball starts from the origin $0$ on the number line, moving once to the right every second for a total of $4$ seconds. Let the position of the ball at the $t$-th second be $P(t)$. It is given that $P(4) = 8$. The displacement of each movement $\Delta P = P(t) - P(t-1)$ must satisfy $\Delta P \in \{-1, 1, 2, 3\}$. In addition, to ensure kinetic energy, the sum of displacements for two consecutive seconds is not allowed to be less than $2$ (i.e., $\Delta P_t + \Delta P_{t-1} \ge 2$). Find the number of possible movement paths of the ball.

## 解答
Analysis:
Let the four displacements be $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$, satisfying $\sum x_i = 8$ and $x_i \in \{-1, 1, 2, 3\}$.
First, consider the case without $-1$ (i.e., $x_i \in \{1, 2, 3\}$):
 • $\{3, 3, 1, 1\} \implies \binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.
 • $\{3, 2, 2, 1\} \implies \frac{4!}{2!} = 12$ ways.
 • $\{2, 2, 2, 2\} \implies 1$ way.
There are a total of $6 + 12 + 1 = 19$ paths without $-1$.
Next, discuss the case containing one $-1$:
$\sum x_i = 8 \implies$ the sum of the remaining three items is $9$.
The only combination is $\{3, 3, 3, -1\}$.
Due to the constraint $\Delta P_t + \Delta P_{t-1} \ge 2$, $-1$ cannot add with any term to be less than $2$.
$-1 + 3 = 2 \ge 2$, which satisfies the condition. Thus, $-1$ can be placed in any position.
The number of permutations is $\frac{4!}{3!} = 4$ paths.
The total number of paths is $19 + 4 = 23$.
