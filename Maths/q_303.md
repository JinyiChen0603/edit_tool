## 题目
On a horizontal test platform, 100 collimated lasers (regarded as straight lines in a plane) are arranged, where no three lasers are concurrent. Definition: If three lasers $\{l_i, l_j, l_k\}$ intersect pairwise and satisfy $l_i \perp l_j$, they are said to generate an "L-signal". Please, by designing the distribution of the incident angles of these 100 lasers, calculate the theoretical maximum number of "L-signals" in this system.

## 解答
Model construction: Suppose among these 100 lines, there are $k$ pairs of mutually perpendicular directions. Let the number of lines in the $i$-th pair of perpendicular directions be $a_i$ and $b_i$, respectively.
Counting principle: For any pair of perpendicular directions $i$, the $a_i b_i$ intersection points within it can each form a right triangle with the remaining $100 - (a_i + b_i)$ lines.
Inequality chain derivation: The total number $|T| \le \sum_{i=1}^k a_i b_i (100 - a_i - b_i)$. Using the AM - GM inequality $4a_i b_i \le (a_i + b_i)^2$, we obtain $4|T| \le \sum_{i=1}^k (a_i + b_i)^2 (100 - a_i - b_i)$.
Extremum balancing: To achieve the maximum value when $\sum (a_i + b_i) = 100$, we need to set the terms inside each parenthesis equal, i.e., $a_i = b_i = 25$. At this point, $k = 2$, meaning there are two pairs of mutually perpendicular directions (a total of 4 directions, with 25 lines in each direction).
Calculation: $|T|_{\text{max}} = 100 \times 25^2 = 62500$. Answer: 62500.

## 答案
62500
