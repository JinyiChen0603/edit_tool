## 题目
Problem Description: In a novel error-correction coding protocol, a system processes a sequence containing 1992 discrete pulse signals. The intensities of these signals correspond exactly to each element in the set $ \Omega = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, 1992\}$. Let $(\varepsilon_1, \varepsilon_2, \dots, \varepsilon_{1992})$ be a random permutation of the elements in $ \Omega$. To evaluate the volatility of the sequence, the "Hierarchical Residual" $ \mathcal{R}$ of the signal flow is defined according to the following recursive processing logic: The initial Hedge: The first-level residual is the absolute difference between the intensities of the first two signals: $$r_2 = |\varepsilon_1 - \varepsilon_2|$$ Recursive Evolution: For each subsequent signal node $k \in \{3, 4, \dots, 1992\}$, the system hedges the previous level's residual against the current signal intensity: $$r_k = |r_{k-1} - \varepsilon_k|$$ Calculate the maximum possible value of the final output residual $ \mathcal{R} = r_{1992}$ across all possible permutations of $ \Omega$.

## 解答
Solution and Proof
1. Parity Invariant Analysis
Observe that for any integers  and , the following congruence holds:
$$|a - b| \equiv a - b \equiv a + b \pmod{2}$$
Applying this property recursively to the definition of :
$$r_k = |r_{k-1} - \varepsilon_k| \equiv r_{k-1} + \varepsilon_k \pmod{2}$$
By induction, the final residual  satisfies:
$$\mathcal{R} = r_{1992} \equiv \varepsilon_1 + \varepsilon_2 + \dots + \varepsilon_{1992} \pmod{2}$$
The sum of all elements in  is calculated using the arithmetic series formula:
$$S = \sum_{i=1}^{1992} i = \frac{1992 \times (1992 + 1)}{2} = 996 \times 1993$$
Since  is an even number, the sum  is even. Therefore,  must be an even integer, implying .

2. Upper Bound Determination
The recursive structure  acts as a ``shrinking'' operator. For a set of consecutive integers , the maximum value is highly constrained:
- Because the total sum parity is even,  cannot be .
- It can be shown that for any , if the total sum is even, the maximum achievable value for this specific nested absolute difference is .
- Any attempt to keep the residual high (e.g., by subtracting small numbers from a large difference) is eventually neutralized by the remaining large numbers in the set, which will force the residual back toward a minimal value.

3. Conclusion
Since the parity of the sum of the set  is even, and given the recursive properties of the absolute difference on a contiguous set, the maximum achievable residual is the smallest positive even integer.
