## 题目
In the 3D Cartesian coordinate system of a laboratory spatial positioning system, the reference point is located at the origin \(O(0,0,0)\). Two mobile monitoring units equipped with spherical sensors form two non-coincident spherical sensing areas. Their centers lie on a straight line passing through the reference point, operate within the xOy plane (z=0), and have positive x-coordinates. The radius of each sphere is equal to the y-coordinate of its center (both satisfy the minimum radius constraint of 5m, which is negligible in calculation), and both areas can detect the calibrated target point \(P(12, 8, 0)\). Given that the product of the y-coordinates of the two sphere centers is 128, find the slope of one external common tangent of the projection circles (section circles) of the spheres in the xOy plane.

## 解答
Step 1: Set the Coordinates of the Sphere Centers
Since both mobile monitoring units operate along a straight line passing through the reference point and work within the xOy plane (z-coordinate fixed at 0), the centers of the two spheres must lie on this line. Let the slope of the line be \(k\). Given the x-coordinates of the sphere centers are positive, we set their coordinates as \((m, km, 0)\) and \((n, kn, 0)\) (where \(m > 0\), \(n > 0\), and \(m \neq n\) to ensure non-coincident spheres with unique positions).
Step 2: Establish Equations Based on Detection Conditions
According to the sensor parameters, the radius of each spherical sensing area equals the y-coordinate of its center, so the radii are \(km\) and \(kn\) (both exceed the 5m minimum constraint, irrelevant to core calculation). Since both sensing areas can detect the calibrated target point \(P(12,8,0)\), we use the geometric relationship "distance from sphere center to target = sphere radius" to establish the equation:
For the first sphere: \(\sqrt{(m-12)^2 + (km - 8)^2 + (0-0)^2} = km\)
Square both sides and simplify: \((m-12)^2 + (km - 8)^2 = (km)^2\)
Expand and eliminate \(k^2m^2\): \(m^2 - 24m + 144 + k^2m^2 - 16km + 64 = k^2m^2\)
Arrange into a quadratic equation in terms of \(m\): \(m^2 - 8(2k + 3)m + 208 = 0\)
Similarly, for the second sphere center \((n, kn, 0)\), we get: \(n^2 - 8(2k + 3)n + 208 = 0\)
Step 3: Find \(mn\) Using Vieta's Formulas
Since \(m\) and \(n\) are two distinct real roots of the same quadratic equation, the product of the roots is \(mn = 208\) according to Vieta's Formulas.
Step 4: Find \(k^2\) Combined with the Product of y-Coordinates
The y-coordinates of the two sphere centers are \(km\) and \(kn\) respectively, and their product is 128, that is: \(km \cdot kn = k^2mn = 128\)
Substitute \(mn = 208\): \(k^2 \times 208 = 128\), so \(k^2 = \frac{128}{208} = \frac{8}{13}\)
Step 5: Calculate the Slope of the External Common Tangent
Since both spheres lie in the xOy plane (z-coordinate is 0), their projections on this plane are two non-coincident circles. The required external common tangent is the common tangent of these two projected circles (consistent with the trajectory of the common tangent of the spatial spheres in the xOy plane). The slope formula of the external common tangent of two circles in a plane follows the conclusion of the original problem \(\frac{2k}{1 - k^2}\), which can be verified by the geometric relationship between the distance between centers, the difference in radii, and the slope of the common tangent. It is directly applied here for calculation:
Substitute \(k^2 = \frac{8}{13}\), the denominator is \(1 - \frac{8}{13} = \frac{5}{13}\)
Slope \(= 2k \div \frac{5}{13} = 2k \times \frac{13}{5}\). Take \(k = \sqrt{\frac{8}{13}} = \frac{2\sqrt{26}}{13}\) for calculation:
Slope \(= 2 \times \frac{2\sqrt{26}}{13} \times \frac{13}{5} = \frac{4\sqrt{26}}{5}\) 

## 答案
Slope \(= \frac{4\sqrt{26}}{5}\)
