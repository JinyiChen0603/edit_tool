## 题目
Let planar vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ satisfy
\[
|\mathbf{u}| = 5,\quad |\mathbf{v}| = 6,\quad \mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v} = -5.
\]
A triangle is constructed whose side lengths are
\[
|\mathbf{u}|,\quad |\mathbf{v}|,\quad |\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}|.
\]
A circle of radius $r$ is placed arbitrarily in the plane.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Determine whether the triangle is acute, right, or obtuse.
\item[(b)] Find the maximum possible number of intersection points between the boundary of the triangle and the circle.
\item[(c)] Describe geometrically why this maximum cannot be exceeded.
\end{enumerate}


## 解答
\textbf{Solution.}

\textbf{(a) Shape of the triangle.}

By the law of cosines,
\[
|\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}|^2
= |\mathbf{u}|^2 + |\mathbf{v}|^2 + 2\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}
= 5^2 + 6^2 + 2(-5)
= 25 + 36 - 10
= 51.
\]
Thus,
\[
|\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{51}.
\]

Compare squares:
\[
5^2 + 6^2 = 61 > 51,
\]
so the angle between sides $5$ and $6$ is \emph{acute}.  
Next,
\[
5^2 + 51 = 76 > 36,\quad 6^2 + 51 = 87 > 25.
\]
Hence all angles are less than $90^\circ$, and the triangle is \textbf{acute}.

\textbf{(b) Maximum number of intersection points.}

A circle can intersect each side of a triangle in at most $2$ points, so the absolute upper bound is $6$.

Because the triangle is acute, there exists a point inside the triangle whose perpendicular distance to each side is strictly less than the corresponding altitude. Placing the circle’s center near this point and choosing $r$ sufficiently small ensures that the circle intersects all three sides in two points.

Therefore, the maximum possible number of intersection points is
\[
\boxed{6}.
\]

\textbf{(c) Why this maximum cannot be exceeded.}

Each side is a line segment, and a circle intersects a line segment in at most two points. No intersection can occur at a vertex with multiplicity greater than $2$, since the boundary is locally linear there.

Thus, regardless of the placement of the circle, the total number of distinct intersection points cannot exceed
\[
2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
\]

Hence $6$ is both an upper bound and an attainable maximum.

\hfill $\square$
