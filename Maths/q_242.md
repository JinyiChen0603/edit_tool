## 题目
In a computer graphics engine, two planar velocity vectors $ \mathbf{a} $ and $ \mathbf{b} $ determine the shape of a triangular mesh, satisfying $ |\mathbf{a}|=3 $ pixels, $ |\mathbf{b}|=4 $ pixels, and $ \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0 $. The mesh is formed using the magnitudes $ |\mathbf{a}| $, $ |\mathbf{b}| $, and $ |\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}| $ as its side lengths. Find the maximum number of contact points where the outline of this triangle can intersect with a circular collision hitbox of radius $ 1 $ pixel.

## 解答
Since $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0$, then $\mathbf{a} \perp \mathbf{b}$. The length of the third side of the triangle is: $$|\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}| = \sqrt{|\mathbf{a}|^2 + |\mathbf{b}|^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5$$ This triangle is a right triangle with sides $3, 4, 5$. The radius $r$ of the inscribed circle of this right triangle is: $$ r = \frac{3+4-5}{2} = 1 $$ It is known that the radius $R = 1$ of the circle is exactly equal to the radius of the inscribed circle. When the circle is in the inscribed position, it has $1$ points of tangency with each of the three sides, for a total of $3$ common points. If the circle is moved so that it intersects two of the right-angled sides (each side creating 2 intersection points), then the distance from the center to the hypotenuse must be greater than 1, resulting in the circle having no intersection points with the hypotenuse. In this case, there are a total of 2 + 2 + 0 = 4 common points. Since $R = r = 1$, it is impossible for a circle to have two intersection points with each of the two sides while also maintaining contact with a third side. The maximum number of common points is 4.
