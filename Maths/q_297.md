## 题目
Here is the new problem scenario translated into English:
**Scenario:**
A logistics engineer is designing a slotting system for an automated warehouse that stores standardized cubic goods. To optimize space utilization, the system determines a "stacking tier" $g(n)$ for a batch of goods based on the quantity $n$, defining it as the integer nearest to $\sqrt[3]{n}$ (representing the edge length of an approximate cubic stack).
**Problem:**
To assess the overall operational efficiency of the system in handling orders of various sizes, the engineer needs to calculate the sum of the "relative access times" for all batch sizes from 1 to 1995. The "relative access time" is defined as the reciprocal of the stacking tier. Calculate this sum:
$$ \sum_{k=1}^{1995} \frac{1}{g(k)} $$

## 解答
When $(k - \frac{1}{2})^4 \leq n < (k + \frac{1}{2})^4$, $f(n) = k$. Thus there are $\left\lfloor \left(k + \frac{1}{2}\right)^4 - \left(k - \frac{1}{2}\right)^4 \right\rfloor$ values of $n$ for which $f(n) = k$. Expanding using the binomial theorem,
$$
\left(k + \frac{1}{2}\right)^4 - \left(k - \frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \left(k^4 + 2k^3 + \frac{3}{2}k^2 + \frac{1}{2}k + \frac{1}{16}\right) - \left(k^4 - 2k^3 + \frac{3}{2}k^2 - \frac{1}{2}k + \frac{1}{16}\right) = 4k^3 + k.
$$
Thus, $\frac{1}{k}$ appears in the summation $4k^3 + k$ times, and the sum for each $k$ is then $(4k^3 + k) \cdot \frac{1}{k} = 4k^2 + 1$. From $k = 1$ to $k = 6$, we get $\sum_{k=1}^6 (4k^2 + 1) = 364 + 6 = 370$ (either adding or using the sum of consecutive squares formula).
But this only accounts for $\sum_{k=1}^6 (4k^3 + k) = 4\left(\frac{6(6 + 1)}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{6(6 + 1)}{2} = 1764 + 21 = 1785$ terms, so we still have $1995 - 1785 = 210$ terms with $f(n) = 7$. This adds $210 \cdot \frac{1}{7} = 30$ to our summation, giving $\boxed{400}$.

## 答案
400
