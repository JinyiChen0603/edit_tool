## 题目
Ecological Population DynamicsProblem Statement:In a closed ecological experiment, 4 distinct populations (labeled $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$) are cultivated in a square interaction pattern. The relative density of each population is subject to the following constraints:Total Density Constraint: The sum of the relative densities of the four populations is 4, i.e., $\sum_{i=1}^{4} x_i = 4$.Viability Constraint: The relative density of any population must not be lower than -1, i.e., $x_i \ge -1$.The Interaction Stability Index $T$ is defined as the product of the sums of the relative densities of adjacent populations:$$T = (x_1 + x_2)(x_2 + x_3)(x_3 + x_4)(x_4 + x_1)$$Calculate the maximum and minimum values of the index $T$.

## 解答
Let $y_i$ denote the sum of adjacent populations. We define:$$y_1 = x_1 + x_2$$$$y_2 = x_2 + x_3$$$$y_3 = x_3 + x_4$$$$y_4 = x_4 + x_1$$The objective function becomes $T = y_1 y_2 y_3 y_4$.Step 1: Analyze Constraints on $y_i$Sum Constraint:$$\sum_{i=1}^4 y_i = 2(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4) = 2 \times 4 = 8.$$Lower Bound Constraint: Since $x_i \ge -1$, we have $y_i \ge -2$.Decoupling (The Parity Property):For a square (4-cycle), the alternating sum vanishes:$$y_1 - y_2 + y_3 - y_4 = (x_1+x_2) - (x_2+x_3) + (x_3+x_4) - (x_4+x_1) = 0$$This implies $y_1 + y_3 = y_2 + y_4$.Since the total sum is 8, we must have:$$y_1 + y_3 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad y_2 + y_4 = 4$$This allows us to analyze the product $T$ as the product of two independent pairs: $P_{odd} = y_1 y_3$ and $P_{even} = y_2 y_4$.Step 2: Extremum Analysis of a Single PairConsider two variables $a, b$ such that $a + b = 4$ and $a, b \ge -2$. Let $P = ab$.Substituting $b = 4 - a$, we get $P(a) = a(4 - a)$. This is a downward-opening parabola.The domain for $a$ is determined by the constraints $a \ge -2$ and $b \ge -2 \implies 4-a \ge -2 \implies a \le 6$.So, $a \in [-2, 6]$.Maximum of $P$: Occurs at the vertex $a = 2$.$P_{max} = 2 \times 2 = 4$.Minimum of $P$: Occurs at the endpoints $a = -2$ or $a = 6$.$P_{min} = -2 \times (4 - (-2)) = -2 \times 6 = -12$.So, for both the odd pair ($P_{odd}$) and the even pair ($P_{even}$), the range of values is $[-12, 4]$.Step 3: Global Extremum Calculation$T = P_{odd} \times P_{even}$.Maximum Value ($T_{max}$):To maximize the product, the two factors should have the same sign and largest absolute values.Case A (Both Positive): $4 \times 4 = 16$.Case B (Both Negative): $(-12) \times (-12) = 144$.Comparing the two, $T_{max} = 144$.Verification of Construction: Set $y_{odd} = \{-2, 6\}$ and $y_{even} = \{-2, 6\}$. Sequence $y = \{-2, -2, 6, 6\}$.Solving for $x$: Let $x_2 = -1$. Then $x_1 = -1, x_3 = -1, x_4 = 7$.Check constraints: $x_i \ge -1$ (True), $\sum x = 4$ (True). Valid.Minimum Value ($T_{min}$):To minimize the product, the two factors should have opposite signs with largest absolute values.We set one pair to its maximum positive value (4) and the other to its minimum negative value (-12).$T_{min} = 4 \times (-12) = -48$.Verification of Construction: Set $y_{odd} = \{2, 2\}$ and $y_{even} = \{-2, 6\}$. Sequence $y = \{2, -2, 2, 6\}$.Solving for $x$: Let $x_2 = -1$. Then $x_1 = 3, x_3 = -1, x_4 = 3$.Check constraints: $x_i \ge -1$ (True), $\sum x = 4$ (True). Valid.Conclusion:The minimum value is $-48$ and the maximum value is $144$.
