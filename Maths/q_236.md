## 题目
In a navigational system, a triangular path is defined by waypoints $A$, $B$, and $C$, such that the distance from $A$ to $B$ is greater than the distance from $A$ to $C$, and the angle of turn at waypoint $A$ is $60^\circ$. The system calculates the circumcenter $O$ and the orthocenter $H$ of this geometric path. A search pattern is established along the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting $O$ and $H$. This line intersects the path segment $BC$ at a point labeled $D$, the segment $OB$ at a point labeled $F$, and the segment $OC$ at a point labeled $E$. If the segment $DE$ has a length of 4 and the segment $EF$ has a length of 5, calculate the length of the path segment $AF$.

## 解答
\item \textbf{Construct an Auxiliary Line.}
    
    Connect \( BH \), let it intersect \( AC \) at \( G \), and draw \( OK \perp AB \) at \( K \). Connect \( AO \) and $AH$. Then \( AG = AK \), \( \angle AOK = \angle ACB = \angle AHG \), \( \angle BOC = \angle BHC = 120^\circ \), so \( \triangle AOK \cong \triangle AHG \). Line \( DEF \) passes through \( A \), and \( AD \) bisects \( \angle BAC \).
    
   
    \item \textbf{Derive the Proportional Relationship.}
    
   Since \( \angle DAC = \angle DCE = 30^\circ\), \( \triangle CDE \sim \triangle ADC\). We have \( CD^2 = DE \cdot DA \). Similarly, \( BD^2 = DF \cdot DA \). Thus, 
   \[
   \frac{CD}{BD} = \sqrt{\frac{DE}{DE+EF}} = \frac{2}{3} = \frac{AC}{AB} 
   \]
    \item \textbf{Calculate with the cosine rule.}

    
    From \(\frac{CD}{BD} = \frac{2}{3}\), we get: \(\frac{AC}{AB} = \frac{2}{3}\)  
    According to the Law of Cosines, the ratio of the three sides of \(\triangle ABC\) is:  
    \[
    \frac{AC}{2} = \frac{AB}{3} = \frac{BC}{\sqrt{7}}
    \]  
    Thus, we obtain \(\frac{AB}{BD} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{7}}\). Let \(AB = 5x\) and \(BD = \sqrt{7}x\).  
    
    
    From \(BD^2 = AD \cdot DF\), we get: \(AD = \frac{7}{9}x^2\)  
    According to the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle ADB\), solving the equation gives \(x = \frac{18}{7}\sqrt{3}\)  
    Note that \(AB > AD\)  
    Then \(AD = \frac{7}{9}x^2 = \frac{108}{7}\), So \(AF=AD-DE-EF=\frac{45}{7}\)

## 答案
$\frac{45}{7}$
