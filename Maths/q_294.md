## 题目
A rectangle that is inscribed in a larger rectangle (with one vertex on each side) is called unstuck if it is possible to rotate (however slightly) the smaller rectangle about its center within the confines of the larger. Of all the rectangles that can be inscribed unstuck in a 6 by 8 rectangle, the smallest perimeter has the form $\sqrt{N}$, for a positive integer $N$. Find $N$.

## 解答
Consider a rectangle on the coordinate plane with vertices at $(\pm 4, \pm 3)$ for all four combinations of positive and negative signs. By symmetry, the center of the rectangle is also at the origin, $O$.
Note that such a rectangle is distinct (not overlapping) if its four vertices lie in or on the edges of all four quadrants, and it is not the same rectangle as the larger one. Let the four vertices of this rectangle be $A(4, y)$, $B(-x, 3)$, $C(-4, -y)$, and $D(x, -3)$ for nonnegative $x, y$. Then this is a rectangle, so $OA = OB$, or $16 + y^2 = 9 + x^2$, thus $x^2 = y^2 + 7$.
Reflect $D$ across the side of the rectangle containing $C$ to $D'(-8 - x, -3)$. Then $BD' = \sqrt{(-8 - x - (-x))^2 + (3 - (-3))^2} = 10$ is constant, and the perimeter of the rectangle is equal to $2(BC + CD')$. The midpoint of $BD'$ is $(-4 - x, 0)$, and since $-4 > -4 - x$ and $y \le 0$, point $C$ always lies below $BD'$.
If $y$ is positive, it can be decreased to $y' < y$. This causes $x$ to decrease as well, to $x'$, where $x'^2 = y'^2 + 7$ and $x'$ is still positive. If $B$ and $D'$ are held in place while everything else moves, then $C$ moves $(y - y')$ units up and $(x - x')$ units left to $C'$, which must lie within $\triangle BCD'$. Then we must have $BC' + C'D' < BC + CD'$, and the perimeter of the rectangle is decreased. Therefore, the minimum perimeter must occur when $y = 0$, so $x = \sqrt{7}$.
By the distance formula, this minimum perimeter is
$$
2\left(\sqrt{(4 - \sqrt{7})^2 + 3^2} + \sqrt{(4 + \sqrt{7})^2 + 3^2}\right) = 4\left(\sqrt{8 - 2\sqrt{7}} + \sqrt{8 + 2\sqrt{7}}\right) = 4(\sqrt{7} - 1 + \sqrt{7} + 1) = 8\sqrt{7} = \sqrt{448}.
$$
Therefore, $N$ would equal $448$.

## 答案
448
