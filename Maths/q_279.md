## 题目
In the field of discrete signal feature extraction, consider a sampled sequence $ \mathbf{u} = \{u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n\} $ where $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ and $n \geq 2$. Due to the dynamic range constraints of the quantization hardware, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the sequence is strictly bounded as follows:
$$ \max_{1 \leq i \leq n} u_i - \min_{1 \leq j \leq n} u_j \leq 1 $$
We define the Normalized Inter-correlation Loss Power $P_{loss}$ of the sequence as the arithmetic mean of the squared differences between all possible pairs of samples:
$$ P_{loss} = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} (u_i - u_j)^2 $$
Determine the theoretical maximum value of $P_{loss}$ under the given amplitude constraint.

## 解答
Using the algebraic identity for the sum of squared differences, we can transform the double summation into a single summation form. It is known that:
$$ \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} (u_i - u_j)^2 = n \sum_{i=1}^n u_i^2 - \left( \sum_{i=1}^n u_i \right)^2 $$
Substituting this into the definition of $P_{loss}$:
$$ P_{loss} = \frac{1}{n^2} \left[ n \sum_{i=1}^n u_i^2 - \left( \sum_{i=1}^n u_i \right)^2 \right] = \frac{1}{n} \left[ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n u_i^2 - \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n u_i \right)^2 \right] $$
Let $\sigma^2$ be the population variance of the sequence $\mathbf{u}$, defined as $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum u_i^2 - \bar{u}^2$. Thus:
$$ P_{loss} = \frac{1}{n} \cdot (n \sigma^2) \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 $$

Upper Bound of Variance under Range Constraints
According to the problem constraints, all samples $u_i$ are contained within a closed interval of length $1$ (e.g., $[a, a+1]$). By Popoviciu's Inequality for variance, for any set of $n$ real numbers bounded by the interval $[m, M]$, the variance $\sigma^2$ satisfies:
$$ \sigma^2 \leq \frac{1}{4}(M - m)^2 $$
In this case, $M - m \leq 1$, which implies $\sigma^2 \leq \frac{1}{4}$.

Maximization Condition
The maximum variance $\sigma^2 = \tfrac{1}{4}$ is achieved when the data is maximally dispersed at the boundaries. Specifically, if $n$ is even, the bound is reached when $n/2$ samples are equal to $a$ and the other $n/2$ samples are equal to $a+1$.
Applying this to our objective function:
$$ P_{loss, \max} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sigma^2_{\max} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{8} $$

Conclusion
The theoretical supremum of the Inter-correlation Loss Power $P_{loss}$ under the unit peak-to-peak constraint is $\frac{1}{8}$.

## 答案
$$\frac{1}{8}$$
