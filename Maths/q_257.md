## 题目
Let $\mathcal{V} \cong \mathbb{R}[x]_{\le 4}$ be the vector space of real polynomials with degree at most $4$. Define $\mu = \dim(\mathcal{V})$.
Let G be the Kneser graph $KG(5, 2)$, whose vertices represent the $2$-element subsets of $\{1, \dots, 5\}$ and whose edges connect disjoint subsets (isomorphic to the Petersen graph). Define $\lambda = \chi(G)$, where $\chi(G)$ denotes the chromatic number of $G$.
Consider the space of matrices $\mathcal{M}_{\mu, n}(\{-1, 1\})$ consisting of all $\mu \times n$ matrices with entries restricted to the set $\{-1, 1\}$.
Determine the minimum integer $n$ such that for every matrix $A \in \mathcal{M}_{\mu, n}(\{-1, 1\})$, there exist index sets $I \subset \{1, \dots, \mu\}$ and $J \subset \{1, \dots, n\}$ satisfying the following conditions:

$|I| = |J| = \lambda$
The submatrix $A_{I,J}$ defined by these index sets satisfies the coherence condition:
$$ \left| \mathbf{1}^T A_{I,J} \mathbf{1} \right| = \lambda^2 $$
where $\mathbf{1}$ denotes the column vector of length $\lambda$ with all entries equal to $1$.

## 解答
1. Parameter Identification

Dimension $\mu$: The space $\mathcal{V} \cong \mathbb{R}[x]_{\le 4}$ has a standard basis ${1, x, x^2, x^3, x^4}$, so $\mu = 5$.
Chromatic Number $\lambda$: By the Lovász-Kneser theorem, $\chi(KG(n, k)) = n - 2k + 2$. For $G = KG(5, 2)$, we have $\lambda = 5 - 2(2) + 2 = 3$.
Target Condition: We seek a submatrix $A_{I,J}$ of size $3 \times 3$ such that $|\mathbf{1}^T A_{I,J} \mathbf{1}| = 9$. Since entries are in ${-1, 1}$, this sum equals 9 if and only if all entries are $1$, and $-9$ if and only if all entries are $-1$. Thus, the problem asks for a monochromatic $3 \times 3$ submatrix.

2. Lower Bound ($n > 40$)
Construct a matrix $A$ with $n=40$ that fails the condition.
Consider the set of all possible column vectors $v \in {-1, 1}^5$ that contain exactly three $1$s and two $-1$s, or exactly three $-1$s and two $1$s.

Number of vectors with three $1$s: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$.
Number of vectors with three $-1$s: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$.
Total such distinct vectors = 20.
Let the matrix $A$ consist of exactly 2 copies of each of these 20 vectors. Thus $n = 40$.
In this construction, no three columns are identical. Since any monochromatic $3 \times 3$ submatrix requires 3 columns to have the same value on the same 3 rows, and these columns are "majority-3" types, such a submatrix would imply the existence of 3 identical columns, which we do not have.
Thus, $n \ge 41$.

3. Upper Bound ($n = 41$)
Let $n=41$.
By the Pigeonhole Principle, among the 41 columns, at least $\lceil 41/2 \rceil = 21$ must share the same majority element. Without loss of generality, assume 21 columns have at least three $1$s (majority $1$).
Let $C$ be this set of 21 columns. For each column $c \in C$, identify a set of row indices $R_c \subset {1, \dots, 5}$ with $|R_c| = 3$ such that the entries are all $1$. (If a column has four or five $1$s, arbitrarily choose one subset of size 3).
The total number of possible row subsets of size 3 is $\binom{5}{3} = 10$.
Since we have 21 columns mapping to 10 possible row subsets, by the Pigeonhole Principle:
$$ \lceil \frac{21}{10} \rceil = 3 $$
There exist at least 3 columns (index set $J$) that share the same row index set $I$ (where $|I|=3$) consisting entirely of $1$s.
Consequently, the submatrix $A_{I,J}$ consists entirely of $1$s, satisfying:
$$ \left| \mathbf{1}^T A_{I,J} \mathbf{1} \right| = |9| = 3^2 = \lambda^2 $$
Answer:
The minimum value is 41.

## 答案
$$41$$
