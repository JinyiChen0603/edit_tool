## 题目
Let $\mathbb{Z}^+$ denote the set of positive integers. Consider the set $\mathcal{S} \subset \mathbb{Z}^+$ defined by the following condition:
$$
\mathcal{S} = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \cap [1, 29] \middle| \cos\left(\frac{2\pi(x-1)}{3}\right) = 1 \right\}
$$
Let $n = |\mathcal{S}|$. The elements of $\mathcal{S}$ are assigned bijectively to the vertices of a cycle graph $C_n$ with vertex set $V = \{v_0, v_1, \dots, v_{n-1}\}$, where edges connect $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$ (indices are taken modulo $n$). Let $\phi: V \to \mathcal{S}$ be this bijection.

We define the local potential $\Lambda(v_i)$ of a vertex $v_i$ as the sum of the value assigned to it and the values assigned to its two adjacent neighbors:
$$
\Lambda(v_i) = \phi(v_{i-1}) + \phi(v_i) + \phi(v_{i+1})
$$
Let $\Omega$ be the maximum local potential across the entire graph for a given bijection $\phi$:
$$
\Omega(\phi) = \max_{0 \le i \le n-1} \Lambda(v_i)
$$
Determine the minimum possible value of $\Omega(\phi)$ over all possible bijections $\phi$.

## 解答
Solution Outline: Minimax Optimization on $C_{10}$
1. Decoding the Set $\mathcal{S}$
First, determine the explicit members of set $\mathcal{S}$ based on the condition:
$$ \cos\left(\frac{2\pi(x-1)}{3}\right) = 1 $$
This implies $\frac{x-1}{3} = k$ for some integer $k$, so $x = 3k + 1$.
Within the domain $[1, 29]$, the set is the arithmetic progression:
$$ \mathcal{S} = {1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28} $$
The cardinality is $n=10$. The sum of all elements is:
$$ \Sigma_{\text{total}} = \frac{10}{2}(1 + 28) = 145 $$
2. Establishing the Lower Bound for $\Omega(\phi)$
We define the local potential $\Lambda(v_i)$ as the sum of values on a vertex and its two neighbors.
To find the minimum possible value for the maximum potential $\Omega$, consider a partition of the graph vertices.
Select a vertex $v^$ such that it is assigned the minimum value in $\mathcal{S}$, i.e., $\phi(v^) = 1$.
The remaining 9 vertices in the cycle $C_{10}$ can be grouped into 3 disjoint sets of 3 consecutive vertices (triplets). Let the centers of these triplets be $u_1, u_2, u_3$.
The sum of the local potentials for these three specific centers must equal the total sum of $\mathcal{S}$ minus the value at the isolated vertex $v^$:
$$ \sum_{j=1}^{3} \Lambda(u_j) = \Sigma_{\text{total}} - \phi(v^) = 145 - 1 = 144 $$
Since $\Omega(\phi)$ is the maximum of all local potentials, it must be at least the average of these three specific potentials:
$$ 3 \cdot \Omega(\phi) \ge \sum_{j=1}^{3} \Lambda(u_j) = 144 $$
$$ \Omega(\phi) \ge \frac{144}{3} = 48 $$
3. Construction and Verification
We must demonstrate that a bijection $\phi$ exists where $\max(\Lambda) = 48$.
Consider the following cyclic permutation of $\mathcal{S}$:
$$ (1, 28, 7, 13, 22, 10, 16, 4, 25, 19) $$
Let's verify the local potentials (sums of adjacent triplets):

$19 + \mathbf{1} + 28 = 48$
$1 + \mathbf{28} + 7 = 36$
$28 + \mathbf{7} + 13 = 48$
$7 + \mathbf{13} + 22 = 42$
$13 + \mathbf{22} + 10 = 45$
$22 + \mathbf{10} + 16 = 48$
$10 + \mathbf{16} + 4 = 30$
$16 + \mathbf{4} + 25 = 45$
$4 + \mathbf{25} + 19 = 48$
$25 + \mathbf{19} + 1 = 45$

The maximum value is exactly 48.
Conclusion
The minimum possible value of $\Omega(\phi)$ is 48.

## 答案
$$48$$
