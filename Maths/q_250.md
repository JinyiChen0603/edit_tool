## 题目
Nine chemical storage tanks, numbered $1, 2, \ldots, 9$, are positioned at nine equally spaced points on a circular pipeline. Let $T$ represent the sum of the squares of the differences between the numbers of all adjacent tanks on the circle. Calculate the probability of the configuration that maximizes $T$. Note that arrangements that can be made to coincide by rotation are considered the same; arrangements that coincide after reflection are considered different.

## 解答
\textbf{Solution (concise).}

Place the tanks in a circular order $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_9$ (indices mod $9$). Then
\[
T=\sum_{i=1}^9 (a_i-a_{i+1})^2
=\sum_{i=1}^9 \bigl(a_i^2+a_{i+1}^2-2a_i a_{i+1}\bigr)
=2\sum_{i=1}^9 a_i^2-2\sum_{i=1}^9 a_i a_{i+1}.
\]
Since $\{a_i\}=\{1,2,\ldots,9\}$, the term $\sum a_i^2$ is constant, so maximizing $T$ is equivalent to minimizing
\[
S:=\sum_{i=1}^9 a_i a_{i+1}.
\]
A minimizer must alternate large and small values as much as possible; with 9 (odd), this gives 4 ``peaks'' and 5 ``valleys'' with exactly one valley--valley adjacency. Thus peaks are $\{6,7,8,9\}$ and valleys are $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$, and the adjacent valley pair should be $(4,5)$. The optimal peak--valley adjacencies yield the minimum
\[
S_{\min}=169,
\]
hence
\[
T_{\max}=2(1^2+\cdots+9^2)-2S_{\min}=2\cdot 285-2\cdot 169=232.
\]
Up to rotation, there are exactly two maximizing configurations (a configuration and its reflection, which is counted as different). Therefore the number of favorable arrangements is $2$.

The total number of circular arrangements up to rotation is
\[
\frac{9!}{9}=8!=40320.
\]
Hence the required probability is
\[
\boxed{\frac{2}{8!}=\frac{1}{20160}}.
\]

## 答案
$\frac{1}{20160}$
