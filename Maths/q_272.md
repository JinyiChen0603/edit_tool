## 题目
A laboratory runs a 12-stage evaluation of $n$ autonomous agents.
In each stage, all $n$ agents are totally ordered from rank $1$ (best) to rank $n$ (worst), with no ties.
A strictly decreasing positive-integer reward profile is fixed in advance:
$$
a_1>a_2>\cdots>a_n,\quad a_k\in\mathbb{Z}_{>0}.
$$
At each stage, an agent ranked $k$ receives $a_k$ credits. After 12 stages, agents are ranked by total credits; the overall champion is the unique agent with the largest total (if a tie occurs for first, then no unique champion is declared).
Now consider the moment immediately after stage $11$. Call an agent still viable if there exists some possible ordering of ranks in stage $12$ (keeping the first 11 stages exactly as they already happened) such that this agent becomes the unique overall champion after all 12 stages.
Determine the smallest integer $n$ for which it is possible to choose a reward profile ($(a_1,\dots,a_n)$) with the following robustness property:

For every possible history of the first $11$ stages, there are at least two distinct viable agents after stage $11$.

Give the minimal $n$. (You do not need to list all reward profiles; existence is enough.)

## 解答
To find the smallest $n$, you prove:

Impossibility for $n \le 12$: for any strictly decreasing positive-integer score vector $a_1 > a_2 > \cdots > a_n$, $a_k \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, there exists a possible 11-stage history after which only one agent can still become the unique overall champion.
Constructibility for $n=13$: exhibit one score vector $a_1, \dots, a_{13}$ such that for every 11-stage history, after stage 11 there are at least two agents who can still become the unique champion depending on stage-12 rankings.

Then the minimum is $13$.

1) Why $n \le 12$ cannot work (adversarial history)
Assume $n \le 12$ and fix any score vector
$ a_1 > a_2 > \cdots > a_n, \quad a_k \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}.$
Construct a “bad” 11-stage history

Pick an agent (A). Make (A) rank 1st in each of the first 11 stages.
For every other agent (X ≠ A), arrange the first 11 stages so that (X) is last at least once.

This is feasible because there are 11 stages and at most $(n-1) \le 11$ non-(A) agents, so you can “assign” a last-place finish to each of them in some stage.
Why this forces a unique viable agent after stage 11
After 11 stages:

Agent (A) has total
$$S_A^{(11)} = 11a_1.$$

Any other agent (X ≠ A) has at least one last-place score $a_n$, and in the remaining 10 stages they can score at most $a_1$ each (and in fact they cannot be 1st in all 10 of those while (A) is also 1st, but we don’t even need that refinement). So
$$S_X^{(11)} \le 10a_1 + a_n < 11a_1 = S_A^{(11)}.$$

Now consider stage 12. The best possible one-stage swing in favor of some challenger (X) against (A) is when (X) gets (a_1) and (A) gets (a_n), i.e. swing $(a_1-a_n)$. But (A) already leads (X) by at least
$$S_A^{(11)} - S_X^{(11)} \ge 11a_1 - (10a_1+a_n)=a_1-a_n.$$
So (X) cannot strictly overtake (A) after stage 12. At best, (X) can tie, which does not produce a unique champion.
Therefore, after this 11-stage history, only (A) can still be the unique champion. This violates the requirement (“at least two viable agents after stage 11 no matter what happened”), so the desired property is impossible for $n \le 12$. Hence:
$$n \ge 13.$$

2) Why $n=13$ works (explicit scoring + pigeonhole)
Now set $n=13$. Choose a score vector with a “compressed top block” and a huge drop at the bottom, e.g.
$$a_1 = 1011,\ a_2 = 1010,\ \dots,\ a_{12} = 1000,\ a_{13} = 1.$$
Take any history of the first 11 stages. Let (A) be the current leader after stage 11.
Step 1: Find a special rival (B) (pigeonhole principle)
Across the first 11 stages, there are 11 occurrences of “someone is last.” If all 12 agents other than (A) had been last at least once, that would require at least 12 last-place occurrences—impossible.
So among the 12 non-leaders, there exists an agent (B) who was never last in the first 11 stages.
Step 2: Bound the score gap between (A) and (B)

The leader (A) can score at most $a_1$ per stage, so
$$S_A^{(11)} \le 11a_1 = 11121.$$

Since (B) was never last, in each of the 11 stages (B) scored at least $a_{12}=1000$, so
$$S_B^{(11)} \ge 11a_{12} = 11000.$$

Thus the leader’s advantage satisfies
$$S_A^{(11)} - S_B^{(11)} \le 11121-11000 = 121.$$
Step 3: Show two agents are viable after stage 11

(A) is viable: If (A) ranks high in stage 12, it can remain (or become) the unique champion.
(B) is also viable: If in stage 12, (A) is placed last (score $a_{13}=1$) while (B) is placed 12th or better (score at least $a_{12}=1000$), then (B) gains at least
$$a_{12}-a_{13}=999$$
relative to (A) in that final stage—far exceeding the maximum possible 11-stage gap of (121). So (B) overtakes (A) and becomes the unique champion.

Hence, regardless of the first 11 stages, after stage 11 there are at least two viable agents ((A) and such a (B)).
Therefore $n=13$ is achievable, and combined with the lower bound, the minimum is:
$$\boxed{13}.$$

## 答案
$$13$$
