## 题目
Let $V = \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_6\}$ be a set of six points fixed on the unit circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. Determine the set of all real numbers $\alpha$ for which Player A has a winning strategy in the following game:

Partition Phase: Player A selects exactly three points from $V$ to form a set $S_A$. The remaining three points automatically form set $S_B$.

Weighting Phase: Let $\mathcal{C}_A$ and $\mathcal{C}_B$ denote the convex hulls of $S_A$ and $S_B$, respectively. Let $\mathcal{A}(C)$ denote the area of a convex hull $C$.

Winning Condition: Player A wins if, for every $w_B \in [1, 2]$ chosen by Player B, there exists a $w_A \in [1, 2]$ that Player A can choose such that the following inequality holds:

$$
w_A \cdot \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{C}_A) - w_B \cdot \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{C}_B) \ge \alpha
$$

Otherwise, Player B wins.

## 解答
The set of all real numbers $\alpha$ is $\{ \alpha \in \mathbb{R} \mid \alpha \le 0 \}$.

Proof:
1. Geometric Equilibrium: Let the points $v_1, \dots, v_6$ be vertices of a regular hexagon. For any subset $S_A$ of 3 points, let $S_B = V \setminus S_A$. It is known that the maximum area for a triangle formed by these vertices is achieved when the points form an equilateral triangle, specifically $\mathcal{A}_{max} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4}$.

2. Player A's Strategy: Player A chooses $S_A$ such that the points form an equilateral triangle (e.g., $\{v_1, v_3, v_5\}$). Consequently, $S_B$ also forms an equilateral triangle ($\{v_2, v_4, v_6\}$), and $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{C}_A) = \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{C}_B) = S_0$.

3. Weighting Logic: The condition $w_A \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{C}_A) - w_B \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{C}_B) \ge \alpha$ simplifies to $w_A S_0 - w_B S_0 \ge \alpha$.
- If $\alpha \le 0$, for any $w_B \in [1, 2]$, Player A can simply choose $w_A = w_B$, resulting in $0 \ge \alpha$. Thus, A wins.
- If $\alpha > 0$, Player B can choose $w_B$ such that even with A's maximum choice $w_A = 2$, the inequality fails. Since the maximum value of $(w_A - w_B)S_0$ given $w_A, w_B \in [1, 2]$ can be reduced to 0 or less by Player B (by choosing $w_B \ge w_A$), Player A cannot guarantee a positive value.

Therefore, Player A has a winning strategy if and only if $\alpha \le 0$.

## 答案
$$\alpha \in (-\infty, 0]$$
