## 题目
Let $V = \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_6\}$ be a set of six points fixed on the unit circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. Determine the set of all real numbers $\alpha$ for which Player A has a winning strategy in the following game:

Partition Phase: Player A selects exactly three points from $V$ to form a set $S_A$. The remaining three points automatically form set $S_B$.

Weighting Phase: Let $\mathcal{C}_A$ and $\mathcal{C}_B$ denote the convex hulls of $S_A$ and $S_B$, respectively. Let $\mathcal{A}(C)$ denote the area of a convex hull $C$.

Winning Condition: Player A wins if, for every $w_B \in [1, 2]$ chosen by Player B, there exists a $w_A \in [1, 2]$ that Player A can choose such that the following inequality holds:

$$
w_A \cdot \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{C}_A) - w_B \cdot \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{C}_B) \ge \alpha
$$

Otherwise, Player B wins.

## 解答
\textbf{Answer.}

The set of all real numbers $\alpha$ is
\[
\boxed{(-\infty,\,0]}.
\]

\textbf{Proof Structure.}

To determine the valid range of $\alpha$, we must ensure Player~A can win for any given set of points $V$. This requires a two-step analysis:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Sufficiency:} Proving A wins when $\alpha \le 0$ for any configuration.
  \item \textbf{Necessity:} Proving A fails when $\alpha > 0$ in a specific worst-case configuration.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Step 1: Sufficiency (General Strategy for any $V$).}

For any arbitrary set of $6$ points on the unit circle, Player~A adopts the following strategy:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Partition:} Player~A iterates through all possible partitions and selects the set $S_A$ that maximizes the convex hull area. By definition, this ensures
  \[
  \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{C}_A) \ge \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{C}_B).
  \]

  \item \textbf{Weighting:} If $\alpha \le 0$, Player~A chooses $w_A = w_B$ (or simply $w_A = 2$). Since $S_A \ge S_B$ and $w_A \ge w_B$ is achievable (or at least $w_A$ can match $w_B$), the expression
  \[
  w_A S_A - w_B S_B
  \]
  will be non-negative.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Specifically, even if Player~B chooses the maximum $w_B = 2$, Player~A chooses $w_A = 2$.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Result:}
  \[
  2(S_A - S_B) \ge 0 \ge \alpha.
  \]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion:} Player~A guarantees a win for all $\alpha \le 0$.

\medskip

\textbf{Step 2: Necessity (The Counter-Example Analysis).}

To prove $\alpha$ cannot be positive, we examine the worst-case scenario for Player~A, where the geometric advantage is minimized.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Configuration:} Let $V$ be the vertices of a regular hexagon.

  \item \textbf{Symmetry Argument:} Due to the central symmetry of a regular hexagon, for any subset of three points $S_A$ chosen by Player~A, the remaining three points $S_B$ form a congruent triangle (either rotated or reflected).

  \item \textbf{Consequence:} In this specific case,
  \[
  \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{C}_A) = \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{C}_B) = S_0
  \]
  always holds. Player~A cannot create an area gap.

  \item \textbf{The Loss:} The winning condition simplifies to
  \[
  (w_A - w_B) S_0 \ge \alpha.
  \]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If $\alpha > 0$, Player~B (who moves second) can choose $w_B = 2$.
    \item The maximum value Player~A can achieve is when $w_A = 2$, resulting in
    \[
    (2 - 2) S_0 = 0.
    \]
    \item Since $0 < \alpha$ is false, Player~A loses in this configuration.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion:} Since Player~A cannot guarantee a win for the regular hexagon case when $\alpha > 0$, the set of valid values is strictly limited to
\[
\alpha \le 0.
\]
