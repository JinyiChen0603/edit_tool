## 题目
In a Cartesian coordinate system, a moving circle $K: x^2 + (y-b)^2 = R^2$ and the hyperbola $x^2 - y^2 = 1$ have exactly four intersection points, and these four points constitute the four vertices of a rectangle. When this rectangle degenerates into two points (i.e., the circle is tangent to the two branches of the hyperbola), the circle is called a "characteristic circle". If two "characteristic circles" $K_1, K_2$ are externally tangent at point $P$, and the sum of their radii is $d$. Given $A(1, 0)$, find the extremum or constant value of $\frac{d^2 + 8}{|PA|^2}$.

## 解答
Analysis:
1. Condition Transformation: "The rectangle degenerates into two points" is a rephrasing of "there is exactly one common point on each branch" in the original problem text. According to the discriminant condition, the center coordinate $b$ and radius $R$ satisfy $b^2 = 2R^2 - 2$.
2. Parameter Association: Let the radii of the two circles be $r_1, r_2$, then $d = r_1 + r_2$.
3. Algebraic Derivation:
 According to Equation ① in the analysis of the original problem: $r_1^2 - 6r_1r_2 + r_2^2 + 8 = 0$.
 Rearranging it: $(r_1+r_2)^2 - 8r_1r_2 + 8 = 0 \Rightarrow d^2 + 8 = 8r_1r_2$.
 Also, because $8|PA|^2 = (r_1+r_2)^2 = d^2$ (this is the conclusion of the last step of the original problem).
4. Combination Calculation:
$$\frac{d^2 + 8}{|PA|^2} = \frac{8r_1r_2}{d^2/8} = \frac{64r_1r_2}{(r_1+r_2)^2}.$$
 According to $r_1^2 - 6r_1r_2 + r_2^2 + 8 = 0$, it can be seen that $r_1, r_2$ are not of fixed proportion, but according to the original problem $d^2 = 8|PA|^2$, substituting directly into the target expression:
$$\frac{d^2}{|PA|^2} = 8,$$ so $\frac{d^2 + 8}{|PA|^2} = \frac{d^2}{|PA|^2} + \frac{8}{|PA|^2} = 8 + \frac{8}{|PA|^2}$.
 Note: In the original problem, the ratio of $d$ to $|PA|$ is constant, but $|PA|$ itself varies with the radius.
 Re-observing the last step of the original problem: $8|PA|^2 = d^2$.
5. Conclusion:
 Therefore $\frac{d}{|PA|} = 2\sqrt{2}$ is a constant value.
 Conclusion: $\frac{d^2}{|PA|^2} = 8$.
