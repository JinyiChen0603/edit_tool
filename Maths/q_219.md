## 题目
A pyramid-shaped grain silo ABCD is constructed from concrete. Points P, Q, R, S are located on edges AB, BD, CD, CA respectively such that the ratios $AP:PB$ and $AS:SC$ both equal $1:1$, while the ratios $BQ:QD$ and $CR:RD$ both equal $1:2$. A partition wall passing through points P, Q, R, S divides the silo into two compartments. Determine the ratio of the volumes of the two compartments (smaller to larger).

## 解答
Step 1: As shown in the figure, by the given conditions, line segments $PS$ and $QR$ are both parallel to line segment $BC$. Consequently, points $P, Q, R, S$ are coplanar, and the plane containing them is parallel to $BC$. Now, construct line segment $SX$ parallel to $BP$ and line segment $SY$ parallel to $PQ$, intersecting $BC$ at point $X$ and $QR$ at point $Y$, respectively. In this manner, the solid $PBQRCS$ is partitioned into a triangular prism $BPQ-XSY$ and a quadrilateral pyramid $S-XYRC$.  
Step 2: Let the volume of tetrahedron $A-BCD$ be denoted as $V_{A-BCD} = 1$. To calculate the volume $V_1$ of the triangular prism $BPQ-XSY$, we use the formula for the volume of a prism: $V_1 = 3 \times \frac{PS}{BC} \times \frac{S_{\Delta BPQ}}{S_{\Delta BAD}}$. Substituting the given ratios $\frac{PS}{BC} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{S_{\Delta BPQ}}{S_{\Delta BAD}} = \frac{1}{3}$ into the formula, we obtain:  
$$ V_1 = 3 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{4} $$  
Step 3: Next, we calculate the volume $V_2$ of the quadrilateral pyramid $S-XYRC$. The formula for the volume of a pyramid is $V_2 = \frac{SC}{AC} \times \frac{S_{\Delta XRC}}{S_{\Delta BCD}}$. To find $\frac{S_{\Delta XRC}}{S_{\Delta BCD}}$, we first identify point $Z$ as the intersection of line segment $XY$ and line segment $CD$. Calculating the length of $RZ$:  
$$ RZ = CZ - CR = \frac{1}{2}CD - \frac{1}{3}CD = \frac{1}{6}CD $$  
Since triangles $YZR$ and $XZC$ are similar (due to the parallelism of $SY$ to $PQ$ and the coplanarity of points), the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides:  
$$ \frac{S_{\Delta YZR}}{S_{\Delta XZC}} = \left( \frac{RZ}{CZ} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\frac{1}{6}CD}{\frac{1}{2}CD} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{9} $$  
Thus, the area of triangle $XRC$ is:  
$$ S_{\Delta XRC} = S_{\Delta XZC} - S_{\Delta YZR} = S_{\Delta XZC} - \frac{1}{9}S_{\Delta XZC} = \frac{8}{9}S_{\Delta XZC} $$  
Next, we determine the ratio $\frac{S_{\Delta XZC}}{S_{\Delta BCD}}$. Since $X$ lies on $BC$ and $Z$ lies on $CD$, and the plane containing $P, Q, R, S$ is parallel to $BC$, line segment $XZ$ is parallel to $BC$. Therefore, triangle $XZC$ is similar to triangle $BCD$ with a similarity ratio of $\frac{CZ}{CD} = \frac{1}{2}$. The ratio of their areas is the square of the similarity ratio:  
$$ \frac{S_{\Delta XZC}}{S_{\Delta BCD}} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} $$  
Substituting this into the expression for $S_{\Delta XRC}$, we get:  
$$ \frac{S_{\Delta XRC}}{S_{\Delta BCD}} = \frac{8}{9} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{9} $$  
Now, substituting $\frac{SC}{AC} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{S_{\Delta XRC}}{S_{\Delta BCD}} = \frac{2}{9}$ into the formula for $V_2$:  
$$ V_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{9} = \frac{1}{9} $$  
Step 4: The total volume of the solid $PBQRCS$ is the sum of $V_1$ and $V_2$:  
$$ V_1 + V_2 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{9} = \frac{9}{36} + \frac{4}{36} = \frac{13}{36} $$  
The ratio of the smaller volume to the larger volume is:  
$$ \frac{\text{Smaller Volume}}{\text{Larger Volume}} = \frac{13}{23} $$

## 答案
$$\frac{13}{23}$$
