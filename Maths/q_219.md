## 题目
A aerospace engineering team is designing a tetrahedral structure \( A\text{-}BCD \) for a deep space detector, with a total volume of 27 cubic meters. To install sensor arrays, a cutting plane passing through four points \( P, Q, R, S \) is introduced, satisfying the following technical requirements:  
1. The line segments \( PS \) and \( QR \) are both parallel to the structural beam \( BC \), and \( \frac{PS}{BC} = \frac{QR}{BC} = \frac{3}{7} \);  
2. Points \( P, Q \) are on the face \( ABD \), where \( P \) is on edge \( AB \), and \( Q \) is on edge \( BD \);  
3. Points \( S, R \) are on the face \( ACD \), where \( S \) is on edge \( AC \), \( R \) is on edge \( CD \), and \( \frac{AS}{AC} = \frac{3}{7} \).  
This plane divides the tetrahedral structure into two parts. Let the convex polyhedron formed by points \( P, B, Q, R, C, S \) be \( PBQRCS \). Find the ratio of the volume of polyhedron \( PBQRCS \) to the volume of the remaining part of the tetrahedron.

## 解答
In a tetrahedron \(A\text{-}BCD\) with a total volume of 27 cubic meters, a cutting plane passes through four points \(P, Q, R, S\). This plane divides the tetrahedron into two parts, where one part is the polyhedron \(PBQRCS\). Find the ratio of the volume of polyhedron \(PBQRCS\) to the volume of the remaining part of the tetrahedron.
Geometric Construction and Key Relationships
The cutting plane passes through points:
- \(P, Q\) on face \(ABD\) (with \(P\) on edge \(AB\) and \(Q\) on edge \(BD\))
- \(S, R\) on face \(ACD\) (with \(S\) on edge \(AC\) and \(R\) on edge \(CD\))
Additionally, segments \(PS\) and \(QR\) are both parallel to edge \(BC\) with \(\frac{PS}{BC} = \frac{QR}{BC} = \frac{3}{7}\). Point \(S\) divides edge \(AC\) in the ratio \(AS:AC = \frac{3}{7}\).
Key Geometric Relationships
1. **Similar Triangles**: 
   - Since \(PS \parallel BC\) and \(P\) lies on \(AB\), \(S\) lies on \(AC\), triangles \(APS\) and \(ABC\) are similar
   - Therefore: \(\frac{AP}{AB} = \frac{AS}{AC} = \frac{PS}{BC} = \frac{3}{7}\)
   - This means \(P\) divides \(AB\) in ratio \(AP:PB = 3:4\) and \(S\) divides \(AC\) in ratio \(AS:SC = 3:4\)
2. **Parallel Segments**:
   - Similarly, since \(QR \parallel BC\) and \(Q\) lies on \(BD\), \(R\) lies on \(CD\), triangles \(DQR\) and \(DBC\) are similar
   - Therefore: \(\frac{DQ}{DB} = \frac{DR}{DC} = \frac{QR}{BC} = \frac{3}{7}\)
   - This means \(Q\) divides \(BD\) in ratio \(DQ:QB = 3:4\) and \(R\) divides \(CD\) in ratio \(DR:RC = 3:4\)
3. **Plane Intersection**:
   - The cutting plane through \(P, Q, R, S\) forms a parallelogram \(PQRS\) (since \(PS \parallel QR \parallel BC\))
   - The plane cuts two pairs of opposite edges \(AB\) with \(CD\), and \(AC\) with \(BD\) in the same ratio \(3:4\)
Volume Ratio Calculation
A fundamental theorem states: If a plane cuts two pairs of opposite edges of a tetrahedron in the same ratio, it divides the tetrahedron's volume in the same ratio.
In this case, the cutting plane divides:
- Edge pairs \(AB\) with \(CD\) in ratio \(3:4\)
- Edge pairs \(AC\) with \(BD\) in ratio \(3:4\)
Therefore, the volume is divided in ratio \(3:4\), where:
- The part containing vertex \(A\) (smaller volume) = \(\frac{3}{7}\) of total volume
- The remaining part (polyhedron \(PBQRCS\), larger volume) = \(\frac{4}{7}\) of total volume
Given the total volume \(V_{\text{total}} = 27\) m³:
\[V_{PBQRCS} = \frac{4}{7} \times 27 = \frac{108}{7} \text{ m}^3\]
\[V_A = \frac{3}{7} \times 27 = \frac{81}{7} \text{ m}^3\]
The required volume ratio is:
\[\frac{V_{PBQRCS}}{V_A} = \frac{\frac{4}{7}V_{\text{total}}}{\frac{3}{7}V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{4}{3}\]

## 答案
$\frac{4}{3}$
