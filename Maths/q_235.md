## 题目
Consider a triangular steel truss $ABC$ used in a construction project, where the length of member $AB$ exceeds that of $AC$ and the angle at joint $A$ is exactly $60^\circ$. The structural engineers locate the circumcenter $O$ and the orthocenter $H$ of the triangle's geometry. A reinforcement beam is placed along the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting $O$ and $H$. This beam intersects the base member $BC$ at point $D$, the beam segment $OB$ at point $F$, and the beam segment $OC$ at point $E$. Given that the distance from $D$ to $E$ is $4$ and the distance from $E$ to $F$ is $5$, determine the required length of the structural member $AC$.

## 解答
Construct an Auxiliary Line.
Connect $BH$, let it intersect $AC$ at $G$, and draw $OK \perp AB$ at $K$. Connect $AO$ and $AH$. Then $AG = AK$, $\angle AOK = \angle ACB = \angle AHG$, $\angle BOC = \angle BHC = 120^\circ$, so $\triangle AOK \cong \triangle AHG$. Line $DEF$ passes through $A$, and $AD$ bisects $\angle BAC$.

Derive the Proportional Relationship.
Since $\angle DAC = \angle DCE = 30^\circ$, $\triangle CDE \sim \triangle ADC$. We have $CD^2 = DE \cdot DA$. Similarly, $BD^2 = DF \cdot DA$. Thus,
$$
\frac{CD}{BD} = \sqrt{\frac{DE}{DE+EF}} = \frac{2}{3} = \frac{AC}{AB}
$$

Calculate with the cosine rule.
Let $AC = 15x$, $AC = 10x$, since $\angle BAC = 60^\circ$, $BC = 5\sqrt{7}x$ and $DC = 2\sqrt{7}x$.

In $\triangle ADC$, $\angle DAC = 30^\circ$, solve the cosine rule equation
$$
49x^2 - 70\sqrt{3}x + 72 = 0
$$

Then we get $AC = \dfrac{4\sqrt{3}}{7}$.

## 答案
$$\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{7}$$
