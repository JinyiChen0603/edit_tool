## 题目
Consider a triangular steel truss $ABC$ used in a construction project, where the length of member $AB$ exceeds that of $AC$ and the angle at joint $A$ is exactly $60^\circ$. The structural engineers locate the circumcenter $O$ and the orthocenter $H$ of the triangle's geometry. A reinforcement beam is placed along the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting $O$ and $H$. This beam intersects the base member $BC$ at point $D$, the beam segment $OB$ at point $F$, and the beam segment $OC$ at point $E$. Given that the distance from $D$ to $E$ is $4$ and the distance from $E$ to $F$ is $5$, determine the required length of the structural member $AB$.

## 解答
\item \textbf{Construct an Auxiliary Line.}
    
    Connect \( BH \), let it intersect \( AC \) at \( G \), and draw \( OK \perp AB \) at \( K \). Connect \( AO \) and $AH$. Then \( AG = AK \), \( \angle AOK = \angle ACB = \angle AHG \), \( \angle BOC = \angle BHC = 120^\circ \), so \( \triangle AOK \cong \triangle AHG \). Line \( DEF \) passes through \( A \), and \( AD \) bisects \( \angle BAC \).
    
   
    \item \textbf{Derive the Proportional Relationship.}
    
   Since \( \angle DAC = \angle DCE = 30^\circ\), \( \triangle CDE \sim \triangle ADC\). We have \( CD^2 = DE \cdot DA \). Similarly, \( BD^2 = DF \cdot DA \). Thus, 
   \[
   \frac{CD}{BD} = \sqrt{\frac{DE}{DE+EF}} = \frac{2}{3} = \frac{AC}{AB} 
   \]
    \item \textbf{Calculate with the cosine rule.}

    
    From \(\frac{CD}{BD} = \frac{2}{3}\), we get: \(\frac{AC}{AB} = \frac{2}{3}\)  
    According to the Law of Cosines, the ratio of the three sides of \(\triangle ABC\) is:  
    \[
    \frac{AC}{2} = \frac{AB}{3} = \frac{BC}{\sqrt{7}}
    \]  
    Thus, we obtain \(\frac{AB}{BD} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{7}}\). Let \(AB = 5x\) and \(BD = \sqrt{7}x\).  
    
    
    From \(BD^2 = AD \cdot DF\), we get: \(AD = \frac{7}{9}x^2\)  
    According to the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle ADB\), solving the equation gives \(x = \frac{18}{7}\sqrt{3}\)  
    Note that \(AB > AD\)  
    Then \(AC = \frac{2}{3} \times AB = \frac{10}{3}x = \frac{60}{7}\sqrt{3}\)

## 答案
$\frac{60}{7}\sqrt{3}$
