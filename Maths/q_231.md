Problem: The Isolated Central Trapezoid

Definitions:
Let $P$ be a regular $36$-gon with vertices marked $V_0, V_1, \dots, V_{35}$ in counterclockwise order.
Let $O$ be the geometric center of $P$.
We select a set of $4$ distinct vertices to form a convex quadrilateral $Q$.

Constraints:
The quadrilateral $Q$ must satisfy all of the following conditions:
- Q is an Isosceles Trapezoid.
- Q is not a Rectangle.
- Q Strictly Encloses the Center: The center $O$ lies strictly inside the quadrilateral $Q$.
- Q satisfies the Strong Isolation Condition: Any two vertices of $Q$ must be separated by at least $2$ unselected vertices along the perimeter. (Formally, if the indices of the vertices are $i_1, i_2, i_3, i_4$ in order, then the smallest difference $\min(|i_j - i_k| \pmod{36}) \ge 3$).

Question:
Calculate the total number of such quadrilaterals $Q$.

## 解答
Analysis
We analyze the symmetry axes of the regular $36$-gon ($n=36$). An isosceles trapezoid corresponds to a pair of chords perpendicular to one of the $18$ symmetry axes.
To strictly enclose the center, the two chords (bases) must lie on opposite sides of the center.
The Strong Isolation Condition implies that the arc length between any two vertices is $\ge 3$. This applies to the lengths of the two bases and the two legs.

1. Type 1 Axes (Passing through opposite vertices)
There are $n/2 = 18$ such axes. Consider the axis through $V_0$ and $V_{18}$.
The chords are perpendicular to this axis. The "equator" is the diameter connecting $V_9$ and $V_{27}$. Since we must strictly enclose the center, we cannot use the diameter as a base.
We select one chord from the "Upper" region ($V_0$ side) and one from the "Lower" region ($V_{18}$ side).

Defining Parameters:
- Upper Chord ($C_x$): Defined by offset $x$ from $V_0$. Vertices: $V_x, V_{36-x}$.
  Range of $x$: $1 \le x \le 8$ (Since $x=9$ is the diameter).
- Lower Chord ($C_y$): Defined by offset $y$ from $V_{18}$. Vertices: $V_{18-y}, V_{18+y}$.
  Range of $y$: $1 \le y \le 8$.

Applying Isolation Constraints:
- Base Lengths: The arc length of the upper base is $36-x - x = 36-2x$ (major) or $2x$ (minor). The vertices are adjacent via the minor arc $2x$.
  Condition: $2x \ge 3 \implies x \ge 2$.
  Similarly for lower base: $2y \ge 3 \implies y \ge 2$.
  Updated Ranges: $x \in \{2, \dots, 8\}$, $y \in \{2, \dots, 8\}$. (Size $7 \times 7 = 49$).
- Leg Lengths: The leg connects $V_{36-x}$ (upper right) to $V_{18+y}$ (lower right).
  The number of steps between them is $(18+y) - (36-x)$? No, let's count from $V_{18}$.
  Upper vertex is at distance $18-x$ from $V_{18}$. Lower vertex is at distance $y$ from $V_{18}$.
  The arc length is $(18-y) - x$ ... No.
  The indices are: Upper $36-x \equiv -x$. Lower $18+y$.
  Difference: $(18+y) - (-x) = 18 + x + y$. This is the major arc.
  The minor arc between Upper ($x$) and Lower ($18-y$) is: $(18-y) - x = 18 - (x+y)$.
  Condition: $18 - (x+y) \ge 3 \implies x+y \le 15$.

Counting Valid Pairs $(x,y)$:
We need $x, y \in \{2, \dots, 8\}$ such that $x+y \le 15$.
Total pairs in grid: $7 \times 7 = 49$.
Pairs violating $x+y \le 15$:
Max sum is $8+8=16$. Only one pair $(8,8)$ sums to $16$.
Valid pairs: $49 - 1 = 48$.

Subtracting Rectangles:
Rectangles occur when $x=y$.
Possible $x \in \{2, \dots, 8\}$.
Check validity: We need $(x,x)$ to be a valid pair in the set of 48.
The pair $(8,8)$ was removed (sum 16).
So valid rectangles are $x \in \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$.
Count = 6.

Total Type 1: 48 (Trapezoids) - 6 (Rectangles) = 42.
Multiply by 18 axes: 18 × 42 = 756.

2. Type 2 Axes (Passing through midpoints of edges)
There are 18 such axes. Consider the axis through the midpoints of edges $V_0V_1$ and $V_{18}V_{19}$.
The chords are perpendicular to this axis. The center lies between the 9th and 10th rung.
We select one chord "Upper" ($x$) and one "Lower" ($y$).

Defining Parameters:
- Upper Chord ($K_x$): Vertices $V_{1-x}, V_x$. (Indices mod 36).
  Range: The "pole" is the edge midpoint (offset 0.5).
  $x=1$ corresponds to edge $V_0V_1$ (arc 1).
  $x=9$ corresponds to chord $V_{28}V_9$ (arc 17).
  Range $x \in \{1, \dots, 9\}$.
- Lower Chord ($K_y$): Vertices $V_{18+y}, V_{19-y}$.
  Range $y \in \{1, \dots, 9\}$.

Applying Isolation Constraints:
- Base Lengths: Arc length is $(x) - (1-x) = 2x-1$.
  Condition: $2x-1 \ge 3 \implies 2x \ge 4 \implies x \ge 2$.
  Similarly $y \ge 2$.
  Updated Ranges: $x \in \{2, \dots, 9\}$, $y \in \{2, \dots, 9\}$. (Size $8 \times 8 = 64$).
- Leg Lengths: The leg connects $V_x$ (Upper) to $V_{19-y}$ (Lower).
  Arc length: $(19-y) - x = 19 - (x+y)$.
  Condition: $19 - (x+y) \ge 3 \implies x+y \le 16$.

Counting Valid Pairs $(x,y)$:
We need $x, y \in \{2, \dots, 9\}$ such that $x+y \le 16$.
Total pairs: $64$.
Pairs violating $x+y \le 16$ (i.e., sum $\ge 17$):
- Sum 18: $(9,9)$ (1 pair).
- Sum 17: $(8,9), (9,8)$ (2 pairs).
Total violations: 3.
Valid pairs: $64 - 3 = 61$.

Subtracting Rectangles:
Rectangles occur when $x=y$.
We need valid pairs $(x,x)$ where $2x \le 16 \implies x \le 8$.
$x \in \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$. (Note: $x=9$ yields sum 18, which is invalid).
Count = 7.

Total Type 2: 61 (Trapezoids) - 7 (Rectangles) = 54.
Multiply by 18 axes: 18 × 54 = 972.

3. Final Summation
The total number of valid quadrilaterals is:
$$756 + 972 = 1728$$

## 答案
$$1728$$
