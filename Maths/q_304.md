## 题目
On a farm plane, 60 linear induction belts are arranged, where no two induction belts are parallel and no three lines are concurrent. If the region enclosed by three induction belts is an isosceles right triangle, it is defined as an "efficient monitoring element". Under the premise that the inclination angles of the induction belts are only allowed to take specific directions (i.e., the hypotenuse forms a $45^\circ$ angle with the legs), try to find the maximum possible number of "efficient monitoring elements" in this system.

## 解答
Constraint analysis: An isosceles right triangle requires the angles between the hypotenuse and the two legs to be $45^\circ$. Direction setting: Let there be $x$ lines in the leg directions (horizontal and vertical), and $y$ lines in the hypotenuse directions ($45^\circ$ or $135^\circ$), satisfying $x + y = 60$. Quantity model: Among the $x$ lines in the leg directions, let there be $a$ horizontal lines and $b$ vertical lines ($a + b = x$). They form $ab$ right - angle vertices. Each vertex can form an isosceles right triangle with each line in the hypotenuse direction (provided the slopes match). Extremum calculation: By symmetry, when $a = b = 15$ (i.e., there are 30 lines in the leg directions) and $y = 30$ (i.e., there are 30 lines in the hypotenuse directions), the quantity is maximized. $|T| \le \sum a_i b_i (60 - a_i - b_i)$. When $a_i = b_i = 15, k = 2$, $|T|_{\text{max}} = (a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2) \times (60 - 30) = (15^2 + 15^2) \times 30$. Note: Here, each hypotenuse can only correspond to a specific pair of legs. Final calculation: $|T| = 60 \times (\frac{60}{4})^2 = 60 \times 15^2 = 13500$. Answer: 13500.
