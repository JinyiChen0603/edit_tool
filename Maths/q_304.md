## 题目
On a farm plane, 60 linear induction belts are arranged. The inclination angle of each belt must be chosen from the set $\{0^\circ, 45^\circ, 90^\circ, 135^\circ\}$. No two belts are coincident (overlap completely) and no three lines are concurrent (intersect at a single point). An "efficient monitoring element" is defined as an isosceles right triangle formed by three belts. Find the maximum possible number of "efficient monitoring elements".

## 解答
1. Modeling and Grouping:
Given the constraint that inclination angles must be chosen from $\{0^\circ, 45^\circ, 90^\circ, 135^\circ\}$, the 60 linear induction belts are naturally divided into four families of parallel lines based on their angles:
	•	Group $N_1$: $n_1$ lines with angle $0^\circ$ (Horizontal).
	•	Group $N_2$: $n_2$ lines with angle $90^\circ$ (Vertical).
	•	Group $N_3$: $n_3$ lines with angle $45^\circ$.
	•	Group $N_4$: $n_4$ lines with angle $135^\circ$.
Subject to the condition $n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 = 60$. The condition "no three lines are concurrent" ensures that every valid triplet of lines forms a triangle (no degeneracy).
2. Forming Isosceles Right Triangles:
An isosceles right triangle requires two legs perpendicular to each other ($90^\circ$ difference) and a hypotenuse forming a $45^\circ$ angle with the legs.
	•	Type A (Axis-Aligned Legs):
The legs are formed by one line from $N_1$ ($0^\circ$) and one from $N_2$ ($90^\circ$). The hypotenuse must be a line from either $N_3$ or $N_4$.

$$Count_A = n_1 \times n_2 \times (n_3 + n_4)$$

	•	Type B (Diagonal Legs):
The legs are formed by one line from $N_3$ ($45^\circ$) and one from $N_4$ ($135^\circ$) (since they are perpendicular). The hypotenuse must be a line from either $N_1$ or $N_2$.

$$Count_B = n_3 \times n_4 \times (n_1 + n_2)$$

3. Optimization:
Total number of efficient elements $T$:

$$T = n_1 n_2 (n_3 + n_4) + n_3 n_4 (n_1 + n_2)$$
Let $x = n_1 + n_2$ (number of axis-aligned lines) and $y = n_3 + n_4$ (number of diagonal lines).
We know $x + y = 60$.
The equation simplifies to:

$$T = n_1 n_2 y + n_3 n_4 x$$
To maximize this:
	0.	Maximize products: For a fixed sum $x$, $n_1 n_2$ is maximized when $n_1 = n_2 = x/2$. Similarly, $n_3 = n_4 = y/2$.
	0.	Substitute:

$$T = \frac{x^2}{4} \cdot y + \frac{y^2}{4} \cdot x = \frac{xy}{4}(x + y) = \frac{xy}{4} \cdot 60 = 15xy$$

	0.	Maximize Sum: To maximize $15xy$ subject to $x + y = 60$, we set $x = y = 30$.
Thus, the optimal distribution is $n_1 = n_2 = n_3 = n_4 = 15$.
4. Calculation:

$$T = 15 \cdot 15 \cdot (15 + 15) + 15 \cdot 15 \cdot (15 + 15)$$
$$T = 225 \cdot 30 + 225 \cdot 30 = 6750 + 6750 = 13500$$

## 答案
13500
