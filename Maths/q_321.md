## 题目
Define ( S ) as the collection of all points in the Cartesian plane satisfying the equation
$$\big|\;|x| - 2\;| - 1\big| + \big|\;|y| - 2\;| - 1\big| = 1$$
If a physical model of S were constructed using wire with negligible thickness, then the total wire length required would equal $a\sqrt{b}$, where a and b are positive integers and b is not divisible by the square of any prime number. Find the value of $a + b$.

## 解答
In a similar manner to the other posted solutions, we want to find the length of just a piece of this monstrosity and then figure out what fraction of the entire function that piece represents. It's possible to go right for the smallest possible piece that'll help us by letting a = $||x| - 2|$ and b = $|||y| - 2| - 1|$. We then get that b = $1 - a$ (obviously the other way would work too). One specific "case" here is the one where all the numbers in the absolute value bars are positive, and thus where b = $1 - x = -x - 2$. Since we're dealing with compounded absolute values, we can infer that the piece we just found has to be bounded by the two axes - the length of this piece also won't be affected by the constants that are hidden in b. Using the Pythagorean Theorem / distance formula, that tiny length comes out to be $\sqrt{2}$. Because we're working with linear terms only, the presence of six absolute value bars will double the length of the function's graph at each step as we work backward to our original equation. As there are $2^6$ absolute bars to be added back in (three on each side), we find that there are $2^6$ of these pieces of length $\sqrt{2}$, making our answer $2 + 64 = 66$.

## 答案
66
