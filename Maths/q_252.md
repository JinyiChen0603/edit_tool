## 题目
Consider nine relay stations labeled $1,2,\ldots,9$ placed uniformly around a circular communication hub.  
The network load variance is defined as
\[
V=\sum_{i=1}^{9} |a_i-a_{i+1}|^2 ,
\]
where $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_9$ denotes the circular order of the labels (indices taken modulo $9$).

Determine the probability that a random arrangement of the labels maximizes $V$.

Assume that:
\begin{itemize}
\item arrangements equivalent under \emph{rotation} are considered identical;
\item arrangements equivalent under \emph{reflection} are also considered identical.
\end{itemize}

## 解答
\textbf{Solution.}

We write
\[
V=\sum_{i=1}^9 (a_i-a_{i+1})^2
=2\sum_{i=1}^9 a_i^2-2\sum_{i=1}^9 a_i a_{i+1}.
\]
Since $\{a_i\}=\{1,2,\ldots,9\}$, the quantity $\sum a_i^2$ is fixed.  
Hence maximizing $V$ is equivalent to minimizing
\[
S=\sum_{i=1}^9 a_i a_{i+1}.
\]

The minimum of $S$ is achieved when large and small labels alternate as much as possible around the circle.  
Because $9$ is odd, exactly one pair of adjacent small labels must occur, forcing a unique extremal pattern up to symmetry.  
This yields
\[
S_{\min}=169,
\qquad
V_{\max}=2(1^2+\cdots+9^2)-2S_{\min}=232.
\]

\bigskip

\textbf{Counting maximizing arrangements.}

Up to rotation, there are exactly two arrangements achieving $V_{\max}$, which are reflections of each other.  
Under the given assumptions, reflections are identified, so these two arrangements count as one.

\bigskip

\textbf{Total number of distinct arrangements.}

When both rotations and reflections are identified, the total number of distinct circular arrangements is
\[
\frac{9!}{9\cdot 2}=\frac{9!}{18}=20160.
\]

\bigskip

\textbf{Final Answer.}

Exactly one arrangement maximizes $V$ among these $20160$ possibilities.  
Therefore, the desired probability is
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{20160}}.
\]

## 答案
$\frac{1}{20160}$
