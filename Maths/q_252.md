## 题目
Consider nine relay stations labeled $1, 2, \ldots, 9$ placed uniformly around a circular communication hub. The network load variance is defined as the sum of the squares of the differences between the labels of all neighboring stations. Determine the probability of the arrangement that yields the maximum possible variance. Assume that arrangements equivalent under rotation are considered identical, whereas arrangements equivalent under reflection are considered distinct.

## 解答
Solution

Nine balls with distinct labels are placed at the nine equally spaced points on a circle, one ball at each point.
This is equivalent to arranging nine distinct elements in a circular permutation.
Hence, there are $8!$ possible arrangements.
If reflections are also considered equivalent, then the number of essentially different arrangements is
$$
\frac{8!}{2}.
$$

We now determine the arrangements for which the value of $S$ is minimized.

On the circle, there are two possible paths between $1$ and $9$: the shorter arc and the longer arc.
Consider either arc, and suppose the labels of the balls appearing consecutively along this arc are
$$
x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k.
$$
Then
$$
|1 - x_1| + |x_1 - x_2| + \cdots + |x_k - 9|
\ge \left| (1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \cdots + (x_k - 9) \right|
= |1 - 9| = 8.
$$

Equality holds if and only if
$$
1 < x_1 < x_2 < \cdots < x_k < 9,
$$
that is, the ball labels on each arc are arranged in increasing order from $1$ to $9$.

Therefore, the minimum possible value of $S$ is
$$
S_{\min} = 2 \times 8 = 16.
$$

From the above discussion, once the ball labels on each arc are fixed as
$$
\{1, x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k, 9\},
$$
the arrangement that achieves the minimum value of $S$ is uniquely determined.

Among the numbers $1,2,\dots,9$, excluding $1$ and $9$, the remaining seven labels are
$$
2,3,\dots,8.
$$
These seven labels can be divided into two subsets, corresponding to the two arcs.
The subset with fewer elements determines the partition uniquely.
The number of ways to choose this subset is
$$
\binom{7}{0} + \binom{7}{1} + \binom{7}{2} + \binom{7}{3} = 2^6.
$$

Each such choice corresponds to exactly one circular arrangement achieving the minimum value of $S$.
Hence, the number of favorable arrangements is
$$
2^6.
$$

Therefore, the required probability is
$$
P = \frac{2^6}{\dfrac{8!}{2}} = \frac{1}{315}.
$$

## 答案
$$\frac{1}{315}$$
