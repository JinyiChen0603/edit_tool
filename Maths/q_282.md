## 题目
A digital signal processor (DSP) processes a burst of $1992$ distinct energy pulses represented by the set $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, 1992\}$.

The pulses enter the processing gate in a random sequential order $(\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \dots, \sigma_{1992})$, which is a permutation of $\Omega$.

The processor logic is defined by a Recursive Differential Accumulator $D_t$:

$$
D_2 = |\sigma_1 - \sigma_2|
$$

$$
D_t = |D_{t-1} - \sigma_t| \quad \text{for } t = 3, 4, \dots, 1992
$$

The objective is to optimize the input sequence to maximize the final residual output $D_{1992}$.

Calculate the maximum achievable value of $D_{1992}$ across all possible $1992!$ permutations.

## 解答
1. Upper Bound Analysis
Consider the property of the absolute difference function. For any non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$:
$$ |a - b| \le \max(a, b) $$
Applying this recursively:
\begin{align*}
    D_t &= |D_{t-1} - \sigma_t| \\
    D_t &\le \max(D_{t-1}, \sigma_t)
\end{align*}
By induction, the final value $D_{1992}$ cannot exceed the maximum element in the permutation set. Thus:
$$ D_{1992} \le \max(\Omega) = 1992 $$

2. Parity Constraint
Analyzing the operation modulo 2:
$$ |a - b| \equiv a - b \equiv a + b \pmod{2} $$
This implies that the parity of the accumulator at step $t$ is congruent to the sum of all elements processed up to $t$:
$$ D_{1992} \equiv \sum_{k=1}^{1992} \sigma_k \pmod{2} $$
Calculating the sum of the set $\Omega$:
$$ S = \sum_{k=1}^{1992} k = \frac{1992 \times 1993}{2} = 996 \times 1993 $$
Since $996$ is even, $S$ is even. Therefore, $D_{1992}$ must be an \textbf{even number}. Since the upper bound 1992 is even, the value 1992 is a valid candidate.

3. Constructive Proof
To achieve $D_{1992} = 1992$, we set $\sigma_{1992} = 1992$ and require that the processing of the remaining set $\{1, 2, \dots, 1991\}$ results in 0. i.e., $D_{1991} = 0$.

We partition the set $\{1, \dots, 1991\}$ into groups that reduce to 0:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Initial Group (3 integers):} $\{1, 2, 3\}$. Sequence $(1, 3, 2) \to |1-3|=2 \to |2-2|=0$.
    \item \textbf{Subsequent Groups (4 consecutive integers):} For any block $\{m, m+1, m+2, m+3\}$, the sequence $(m, m+1, m+3, m+2)$ processes a current state of $0$ back to $0$:
    \begin{align*}
        |0 - m| &= m \\
        |m - (m+1)| &= 1 \\
        |1 - (m+3)| &= m+2 \\
        |(m+2) - (m+2)| &= 0
    \end{align*}
\end{itemize}
Since $1991 = 3 + 497 \times 4$, we can perfectly arrange the first 1991 numbers to yield 0.
Finally:
$$ D_{1992} = |D_{1991} - 1992| = |0 - 1992| = 1992 $$

\section*{Answer}
The maximum achievable value is:
$$ \boxed{1992} $$

## 答案
$$1992$$
