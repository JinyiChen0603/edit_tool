## 题目
A digital signal processor (DSP) processes a burst of $1992$ distinct energy pulses represented by the set $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, 1992\}$.

The pulses enter the processing gate in a random sequential order $(\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \dots, \sigma_{1992})$, which is a permutation of $\Omega$.

The processor logic is defined by a Recursive Differential Accumulator $D_t$:

$$
D_2 = |\sigma_1 - \sigma_2|
$$

$$
D_t = |D_{t-1} - \sigma_t| \quad \text{for } t = 3, 4, \dots, 1992
$$

The objective is to optimize the input sequence to maximize the final residual output $D_{1992}$.

Calculate the maximum achievable value of $D_{1992}$ across all possible $1992!$ permutations.

## 解答
Problem 1 Analysis

1. Parity Invariant Analysis:
The recursive process is defined by $S_t = | S_{t-1} - \sigma_t |$. Utilizing the modular property $|a - b| \equiv a + b \pmod{2}$, we can trace the parity of the final state $S_{2024}$:
$$ S_{2024} \equiv \sigma_1 + \sigma_2 + \dots + \sigma_{2024} \pmod{2} $$
The sum of the set $\Omega = \{1, 2, \dots, 2024\}$ is given by the arithmetic series formula:
$$ \sum_{k=1}^{2024} k = \frac{2024 \times (2024 + 1)}{2} = 1012 \times 2025 $$
Since $1012$ is even, the total sum is even ($0 \pmod{2}$). Therefore, the terminal state $S_{2024}$ must be an even integer.

2. Extremal Bound Derivation:
In a nested absolute difference structure involving a contiguous set of integers, the result $S_n$ is constrained by the density of the set. For any even sum, $S_n \in \{0, 2, 4, \dots\}$. 
To test if $S_{2024}$ can reach $2$, we consider the construction where we pair consecutive elements to produce $1$s (e.g., $|k - (k-1)| = 1$), and then cancel those $1$s. 
However, due to the specific recursive nature $| \dots |x_1 - x_2| - x_3 | \dots - x_n|$, the maximum value for a set $\{1, \dots, n\}$ where the sum is even is $2$ (unless $n$ is very small). For $n=2024$, $S_{2024} \le 2$.

3. Conclusion:
By constructing a specific permutation that minimizes intermediate cancellations until the final steps, we can achieve the maximum even value.
