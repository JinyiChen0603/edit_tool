## 题目
：Six distinct balls numbered $1, 2, 3, 4, 5,$ and $6$ are placed randomly in a circle. We define a \textbf{Resonant Pair} as any two balls that are positioned directly opposite each other. 
Let $(a_k, b_k)$ denote the values of the three Resonant Pairs (for $k=1, 2, 3$). A pair is defined to be \textbf{Harmonically Stable} if the product of its components is not divisible by $3$. That is:
\[
a_k \cdot b_k \not\equiv 0 \pmod{3}
\]
Find the probability that in a random circular arrangement, \textbf{exactly two} of the three Resonant Pairs are Harmonically Stable. Express your answer as a common fraction in lowest terms.

## 解答
1. Categorization of the Numbers}
We analyze the set $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ based on divisibility by 3:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Divisible by 3 ($M_3$):} $\{3, 6\}$ (2 numbers)
    \item \textbf{Not divisible by 3 ($N_3$):} $\{1, 2, 4, 5\}$ (4 numbers)
\end{itemize}
A pair $(a_k, b_k)$ is \textbf{NOT} Harmonically Stable if at least one of its components belongs to $M_3$.
2. Total Number of Pairings
In a circular arrangement of 6 balls, there are 3 fixed diameters (slots for resonant pairs). The total number of ways to partition 6 distinct balls into 3 unordered pairs is:
\[
\Omega = \frac{\binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{2} \binom{2}{2}}{3!} = \frac{15 \cdot 6 \cdot 1}{6} = 15
\]
Alternatively, fixing ball '1', there are 5 possible partners for it, then 3 for the next, giving $5 \times 3 \times 1 = 15$.
3. Case Analysis
Since there are exactly two numbers ($3$ and $6$) that cause a pair to be unstable, we examine their relative positions:
\paragraph{Case A: 3 and 6 are paired together}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pairs:} $(3, 6)$, $(x, y)$, $(z, w)$ where $x,y,z,w \in \{1, 2, 4, 5\}$.
    \item \textbf{Stability:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $(3, 6)$ is \textbf{not stable} ($18 \equiv 0 \pmod 3$).
        \item $(x, y)$ is \textbf{stable} (no factors of 3).
        \item $(z, w)$ is \textbf{stable} (no factors of 3).
    \end{itemize}
    \item This case results in \textbf{exactly two} stable pairs.
    \item \textbf{Count:} The number of ways to pair $\{1, 2, 4, 5\}$ into 2 pairs is $\frac{\binom{4}{2}}{2!} = 3$.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Case B: 3 and 6 are in different pairs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pairs:} $(3, x)$, $(6, y)$, $(z, w)$.
    \item \textbf{Stability:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $(3, x)$ and $(6, y)$ are \textbf{not stable}.
        \item $(z, w)$ is \textbf{stable}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item This case results in \textbf{exactly one} stable pair.
    \item \textbf{Count:} Total ways minus Case A = $15 - 3 = 12$.
\end{itemize}
4. Final Probability
The event $E$ (exactly two stable pairs) corresponds only to \textbf{Case A}.
\[
P(E) = \frac{\text{Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Outcomes}} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5}
\]
\section*{Conclusion}
The probability that exactly two of the resonant pairs are Harmonically Stable is:
\[
\mathbf{\frac{1}{5}}
\]

## 答案
$$\frac{1}{5}$$
