## 题目
Consider an acoustically treated room designed in the shape of a regular hexagon $ABCDEF$ with wall length $a$. A sound emitter is positioned at the midpoint $M$ of wall $AB$. The sound wave is projected at an angle $\theta$ relative to wall $AB$, satisfying $\angle BMQ = \theta$. The wave reflects specularly off walls $BC$, $CD$, $DE$, $EF$, and $FA$ before arriving back at wall $AB$. To ensure the sound impacts strictly along the interior of the walls and not at the corners, determine the range of possible values for the projection angle $\theta$.

## 解答
Let the side length of the regular hexagon be $a$. The ball starts from the midpoint $P$ of $AB$, and the incidence satisfies the condition that “the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection”. Unfolding (Symmetry) Method: successively reflect the regular hexagon across the sides $BC, CD, DE, EF, FA$ that are struck (5 times in total). Then the broken line path on the table, after reflection, corresponds to a straight line in the unfolded plane, starting from $P$ and passing through these mirrored hexagons, finally reaching a mirrored $AB$. To ensure that each collision point falls inside the corresponding side (not on the vertices), this straight line in the unfolded diagram must lie within the open angle formed by two “critical rays”: the critical rays pass through the corresponding two extreme vertices in the unfolded diagram (once the line goes beyond these rays, it will hit the endpoint of a collision side, thus violating the problem conditions). Establishing Coordinates: take $P$ as the origin, and let $PB$ be the positive $x$-axis. Then $\theta$ is the angle between the ray $PQ$ and the $x$-axis. In the unfolded diagram, the two critical rays pass through the points $M\left(4a,\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}a\right)$ and $N\left(5a,\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}a\right)$. Therefore, the critical slopes are $\tan \angle MPB = \frac{\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}a}{4a} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}$ and $\tan \angle NPB = \frac{\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}a}{5a} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{10}$. To ensure that each collision point is strictly within the side, an open interval should be used (the endpoints correspond to hitting the vertices): $\arctan \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{10} < \theta < \arctan \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}$.

## 答案
$\arctan\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{10} < \theta < \arctan\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}$
