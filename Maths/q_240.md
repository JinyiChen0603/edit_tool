## 题目
A simulation models an electron bouncing within a nanoscale hexagonal gate $ABCDEF$ with edge length $a$. The electron starts from the midpoint $M$ of edge $AB$ with an initial velocity vector that makes an angle $\theta$ with edge $AB$, defined by $\angle BMQ = \theta$. The electron undergoes elastic collisions with edges $BC$, $CD$, $DE$, $EF$, and $FA$ in the specified order and eventually returns to edge $AB$. To guarantee that the electron strikes each edge strictly at an interior point, find the required range of the initial angle $\theta$.

## 解答
Let the side length of the regular hexagon be $a$. The ball starts from the midpoint $P$ of $AB$, and the incidence satisfies the condition that “the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection”. Unfolding (Symmetry) Method: successively reflect the regular hexagon across the sides $BC, CD, DE, EF, FA$ that are struck (5 times in total). Then the broken line path on the table, after reflection, corresponds to a straight line in the unfolded plane, starting from $P$ and passing through these mirrored hexagons, finally reaching a mirrored $AB$. To ensure that each collision point falls inside the corresponding side (not on the vertices), this straight line in the unfolded diagram must lie within the open angle formed by two “critical rays”: the critical rays pass through the corresponding two extreme vertices in the unfolded diagram (once the line goes beyond these rays, it will hit the endpoint of a collision side, thus violating the problem conditions). Establishing Coordinates: take $P$ as the origin, and let $PB$ be the positive $x$-axis. Then $\theta$ is the angle between the ray $PQ$ and the $x$-axis. In the unfolded diagram, the two critical rays pass through the points M$(4a,\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}a)$ and N$(5a,\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}a)$. Therefore, the critical slopes are $\tan\angle MPB=\frac{\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}a}{4a}=\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}$ and $\tan\angle NPB=\frac{\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}a}{5a}=\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{10}$. To ensure that each collision point is strictly within the side, an open interval should be used (the endpoints correspond to hitting the vertices): $\arctan\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{10}<\theta<\arctan\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}$.

## 答案
$\arctan\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{10} < \theta < \arctan\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}$
