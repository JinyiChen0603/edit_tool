## 题目
\textbf{Problem Background.}
In a simulation of a nanoscale hexagonal gate $ABCDEF$ with side length $a$, an electron moves in a straight line until it hits a boundary, where it undergoes an elastic collision (the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection).

\medskip

\textbf{Given Conditions:}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Initial Position:}
  The electron is injected from a point $M$ on side $AB$ such that
  \[
    AM = \frac{1}{4}a, \qquad MB = \frac{3}{4}a.
  \]

  \item \textbf{Motion Path:}
  The initial velocity vector makes an angle $\theta$ with side $AB$ (i.e.\ $\angle BMQ = \theta$).
  The electron successively collides with sides
  \[
    BC,\; CD,\; DE,\; EF,\; \text{and } FA,
  \]
  finally returning to the initial side $AB$.

  \item \textbf{Collision Constraint:}
  Each impact must occur strictly at an interior point of the side (excluding any vertices).
\end{enumerate}

\medskip

\textbf{Problem to Solve.}
Determine the range of possible values for the initial angle $\theta$ such that the electron strikes the five sides in the exact order described and returns to side $AB$.

## 解答
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{The Method of Mirror Reflection (Unfolding).}

  To analyze the path, we reflect the hexagon across the sequence of sides it strikes:
  \[
    BC,\; CD,\; DE,\; EF,\; \text{and } FA.
  \]
  The folded zig-zag path of the electron in the original hexagon becomes a single straight line in the unfolded plane.

  The electron starts at point $M$ in the first hexagon and must reach the segment $A'B'$ (the fifth reflection of side $AB$) in the sixth hexagon without passing through any intermediate vertices.

  \item \textbf{Establishing a Coordinate System.}

  Let the starting point $M$ be the origin $(0,0)$.
  Let the line containing $AB$ be the $x$-axis, with the direction from $M$ to $B$ as the positive $x$-direction.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item In the original hexagon, point $B$ is located at
    \[
      \left( \frac{3}{4}a,\, 0 \right).
    \]

    \item Using the geometry of a regular hexagon (interior angles are $120^\circ$), we calculate the displacement to the target side $A'B'$ after five reflections.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Identifying Critical Vertices.}

  The ``window'' through which the straight line must pass is defined by two critical vertices in the unfolded diagram.
  Based on the geometry of the reflected hexagons:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item The vertical displacement (height) to the target side $A'B'$ is
    \[
      h = 3a \sin 60^\circ = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}a.
    \]

    \item The horizontal displacement for the ``inner'' vertex (denoted $M_{\text{upper}}$) relative to $M$ is
    \[
      4a + \frac{1}{4}a = \frac{17}{4}a.
    \]

    \item The horizontal displacement for the ``outer'' vertex (denoted $N_{\text{lower}}$) relative to $M$ is
    \[
      5a + \frac{1}{4}a = \frac{21}{4}a.
    \]
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Calculating the Angle Range.}

  The angle $\theta$ is determined by the slopes of the rays from $M$ to these two points.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item For the upper bound:
    \[
      \tan \theta_{\max}
      = \frac{\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}a}{\frac{17}{4}a}
      = \frac{6\sqrt{3}}{17}.
    \]

    \item For the lower bound:
    \[
      \tan \theta_{\min}
      = \frac{\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}a}{\frac{21}{4}a}
      = \frac{6\sqrt{3}}{21}
      = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{7}.
    \]
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\medskip

Since the electron must strike the interior of the sides, we use an open interval.

\bigskip

\textbf{Final Answer:}
\[
  \arctan\!\left( \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{7} \right)
  < \theta <
  \arctan\!\left( \frac{6\sqrt{3}}{17} \right).
\]

## 答案
\[
  \arctan\!\left( \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{7} \right)
  < \theta <
  \arctan\!\left( \frac{6\sqrt{3}}{17} \right).
\]
