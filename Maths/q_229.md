## 题目
Problem: The Strictly Internal Isosceles Trapezoid

Definitions:
Let $P$ be a regular $24$-gon with vertices marked $V_0, V_1, \dots, V_{23}$ in counterclockwise order.
We select a set of $4$ distinct vertices to form a convex quadrilateral $Q$.

Constraints:
The quadrilateral $Q$ must satisfy all of the following conditions:
1. $Q$ is an Isosceles Trapezoid.
2. $Q$ is not a Rectangle.
3. $Q$ is Strictly Internal: No side of $Q$ coincides with a side of the regular $24$-gon $P$. (i.e., if the vertices of $Q$ are $\{V_a, V_b, V_c, V_d\}$, then no pair of indices $i$ and $j$ satisfies $|i-j| \equiv 1 \pmod{24}$.)

Question:
Calculate the total number of such quadrilaterals $Q$.

## 解答
Analysis

We classify isosceles trapezoids based on their axis of symmetry. In a regular $n$-gon where $n=24$ (even), there are two types of symmetry axes:

1. Type 1 Axes (Passing through opposite vertices)
There are $n/2 = 12$ such axes. Let us analyze one specific axis passing through vertices $V_0$ and $V_{12}$.
- The chords perpendicular to this axis connect $V_k$ and $V_{24-k}$ for $k=1, 2, \dots, 11$.
- There are $11$ available chords (bases). An isosceles trapezoid is formed by selecting $2$ distinct chords.
- Internal Constraint (Legs): The legs of the trapezoid connect the endpoints of the two chosen chords. If we choose adjacent chords $k$ and $k+1$, the leg connects $V_k$ to $V_{k+1}$, which is a side of the 24-gon. Thus, we must select 2 non-adjacent chords.
- Internal Constraint (Bases): The chords connect $V_k$ and $V_{24-k}$. The shortest chord is $V_1V_{23}$ (distance 2), which is not a side. Thus, Type 1 trapezoids never share a base with the polygon.
- Rectangle Constraint: Rectangles sharing this axis are formed by pairs symmetric around the "middle" chord. The middle is $V_6$. Rectangles are pairs $(k, 12-k)$. The pairs are $(1,11), (2,10), (3,9), (4,8), (5,7)$. There are $5$ such rectangles. None of these pairs are adjacent (e.g., $5$ and $7$ are separated by $6$), so all 5 are valid regarding the leg constraint.

Calculation for Type 1:
- Total ways to choose 2 non-adjacent chords from 11:
$$ \binom{11}{2} - (\text{adjacent pairs}) = 55 - 10 = 45 $$
- Subtract Rectangles: All 5 rectangles are non-adjacent selections.
$$ 45 - 5 = 40 $$
- Total for 12 axes: $12 \times 40 = \mathbf{480}$.

2. Type 2 Axes (Passing through midpoints of opposite edges)
There are $n/2 = 12$ such axes. Let us analyze the axis passing through the midpoints of edges $V_0V_1$ and $V_{12}V_{13}$.
- The chords perpendicular to this axis connect $V_{1-k}$ and $V_k$ (indices mod 24).
- The chords are $C_1$ (edge $V_0V_1$), $C_2 (V_{23}V_2), \dots, C_{12} (V_{13}V_{12})$.
- There are $12$ potential chords.
- Internal Constraint (Bases): $C_1$ is the edge $V_0V_1$. $C_{12}$ is the edge $V_{12}V_{13}$. To ensure no base is a polygon side, we must exclude $C_1$ and $C_{12}$.
- Available chords: $\{C_2, C_3, \dots, C_{11}\}$. Size = $10$.
- Internal Constraint (Legs): Similar to Type 1, choosing adjacent chords $C_i, C_{i+1}$ creates legs of length 1 (polygon sides). We must choose 2 non-adjacent chords from the available set of 10.
- Rectangle Constraint: Rectangles are symmetric pairs $(C_k, C_{13-k})$. We consider $k \in \{2, \dots, 11\}$.
  - Pairs: $(2,11), (3,10), (4,9), (5,8), (6,7)$.
  - Total 5 rectangles.
  - However, we must check the adjacency constraint. The pair $(6,7)$ consists of adjacent chords. This configuration shares legs with the polygon, so it was already removed in the "non-adjacent" step.
  - Surviving Rectangles: $(2,11), (3,10), (4,9), (5,8)$. Total 4.

Calculation for Type 2:
- Total ways to choose 2 non-adjacent chords from 10:
$$ \binom{10}{2} - (\text{adjacent pairs}) = 45 - 9 = 36 $$
- Subtract Surviving Rectangles:
$$ 36 - 4 = 32 $$
- Total for 12 axes: $12 \times 32 = \mathbf{384}$.

3. Final Summation
Non-rectangular isosceles trapezoids have a unique axis of symmetry. Therefore, the sets counted in Type 1 and Type 2 are disjoint.
$$ \text{Total} = \text{Type 1} + \text{Type 2} = 480 + 384 = 864 $$

## 答案
$$864$$
