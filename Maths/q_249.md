## 题目
Problem Description
In a deep-sea scientific expedition lasting three days per cycle, a deep-sea observation station must operate continuously for a total of $270$ hours (i.e., $3 \times 90$ hours).
The observation station is equipped with $7$ high-precision environmental sensors, divided into two groups:
- Group A (Acoustic Group): sensors A1, A2, A3, A4;
- Group B (Optical Group): sensors A5, A6, A7.
Operating Rules
- Exclusivity: Throughout the entire $270$-hour mission period, at any given moment, exactly one sensor is in operation.
- Period Constraints:
  - For each sensor in Group A, the total operating time (measured in hours) must be a positive multiple of $7$.
  - For each sensor in Group B, the total operating time (measured in hours) must be a positive multiple of $13$.
Assuming that the number of on/off switches for each sensor is unrestricted, and considering only the total cumulative operating time of each sensor over the entire mission, determine how many distinct allocation schemes are possible.

## 解答
Solution

Let the total operating time of the $i$-th sensor be $x_i$ hours $(i = 1, 2, \dots, 7)$.  
From the problem statement, we have
$$ x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_7 = 270. $$

The divisibility and positivity constraints are:
$$ 7 \mid x_i \quad (1 \le i \le 4), \qquad
13 \mid x_j \quad (5 \le j \le 7), $$
where $x_i \in \mathbb{Z}^+$.

Let
$$ x_i = 7a_i \quad (1 \le i \le 4), \qquad
x_j = 13b_j \quad (5 \le j \le 7), $$
where $a_i, b_j \in \mathbb{N}^*$. Substituting into equation (1), we obtain
$$ 7(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4) + 13(b_5 + b_6 + b_7) = 270. $$

Let
$$ m = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4, \qquad
n = b_5 + b_6 + b_7. $$
Then
$$ 7m + 13n = 270, \qquad (m \ge 4,\; n \ge 3,\; m,n \in \mathbb{N}). $$

Using modular arithmetic: since $13 \equiv 6 \equiv -1 \pmod{7}$ and $270 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$, equation (2) reduces to
$$ -n \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
n \equiv 3 \pmod{7}. $$

Hence let
$$ n = 3 + 7t \quad (t \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}). $$
Substituting into $7m + 13n = 270$, we obtain
$$ 7m + 13(3 + 7t) = 270
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
7m = 231 - 91t
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
m = 33 - 13t. $$

From the constraint $m \ge 4$, we have
$$ 33 - 13t \ge 4
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
13t \le 29
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
t \le 2.23. $$
Hence $t = 0, 1, 2$, and there are three corresponding solutions for $(m,n)$:
$$(m,n) = (33,3),\ (20,10),\ (7,17). $$

For a fixed pair $(m,n)$, we compute the number of allocation schemes using the stars and bars method:

The number of positive integer solutions to
$$ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = m $$
is
$$ \binom{m-1}{3}. $$

The number of positive integer solutions to
$$ b_5 + b_6 + b_7 = n $$
is
$$ \binom{n-1}{2}. $$

We now compute the number of allocation schemes for each of the three cases:

When $(m,n) = (33,3)$:
$$ \binom{32}{3} \times \binom{2}{2}
= 4960 \times 1
= 4960. $$

When $(m,n) = (20,10)$:
$$ \binom{19}{3} \times \binom{9}{2}
= 969 \times 36
= 34884. $$

When $(m,n) = (7,17)$:
$$ \binom{6}{3} \times \binom{16}{2}
= 20 \times 120
= 2400. $$

Therefore, the total number of distinct allocation schemes is
$$ 4960 + 34884 + 2400 = 42244. $$

There are 42244 distinct allocation schemes in total.
