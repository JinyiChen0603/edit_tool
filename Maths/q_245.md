## 题目
\textbf{Modified Problem}

An art gallery plans to construct a steel frame sunshade structure in an outdoor open space. Its geometric model can be simplified as a quadrangular pyramid $P\!-\!ABCD$. The base $ABCD$ is a horizontally placed rhombus steel plate with side length $2$, and $\angle ABC = 120^\circ$. The lateral edge $PA$ is perpendicular to the plane $ABCD$, serving as the main vertical support column.  

Point $E$ is the midpoint of side $BC$, and point $F$ is the midpoint of the diagonal beam $PC$. A movable spotlight $H$ is installed on the diagonal beam $PD$. Measurements show that when $H$ moves along $PD$ to a certain position, the angle between the connecting cable $EH$ and the side face $PAD$ reaches its maximum value, and at this moment the tangent of this angle is $\sqrt{2}$.  

To reinforce the structure, engineers plan to install connecting components between the plane containing $\triangle AEF$ and the plane containing $\triangle AFC$.  
Find the cosine of the dihedral angle between the planes containing $\triangle AEF$ and $\triangle AFC$.


## 解答
\textbf{Solution}

\textbf{Step 1: Determine geometric parameters}

Since $ABCD$ is a rhombus with side length $2$ and $\angle ABC = 120^\circ$, triangle $ABC$ is an obtuse isosceles triangle. The length of diagonal $AC$ is
\[
AC = \sqrt{2^2 + 2^2 - 2\cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cos 120^\circ}
= \sqrt{4 + 4 + 4} = \sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt{3}.
\]
Because $E$ is the midpoint of $BC$, segment $AE$ is perpendicular to $BC$. Since $BC \parallel AD$, we have
\[
AE \perp AD.
\]
Given $PA \perp$ plane $ABCD$, it follows that $PA \perp AE$, hence
\[
AE \perp \text{plane } PAD.
\]

Let $\theta$ be the angle between $EH$ and plane $PAD$. Then $\theta = \angle EHA$. In right triangle $\triangle EAH$,
\[
\tan\theta = \frac{AE}{AH}.
\]
The angle $\theta$ is maximized when $AH$ is minimized, i.e., when $AH \perp PD$.  

From geometry of the base,
\[
AE = \frac{AC}{2} = \sqrt{3}.
\]
Given $\tan\theta = \sqrt{2}$, we obtain
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{AH} = \sqrt{2}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
AH = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}.
\]

In right triangle $\triangle PAD$, $AD = 2$, and $AH$ is the altitude to hypotenuse $PD$. Using the right-triangle altitude relation,
\[
PA^2 = AD^2 + AH^2 = 4 + \frac{3}{2} = \frac{11}{2},
\]
so
\[
PA = \sqrt{\frac{11}{2}}.
\]

\textbf{Step 2: Establish a coordinate system}

Let $A$ be the origin. Take $AE$, $AD$, and $AP$ as the positive $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes, respectively. Then the coordinates are
\[
A(0,0,0), \quad
B(\sqrt{3},-1,0), \quad
C(\sqrt{3},1,0), \quad
D(0,2,0), \quad
P\!\left(0,0,\sqrt{\tfrac{11}{2}}\right).
\]
Thus,
\[
E(\sqrt{3},0,0),
\qquad
F\!\left(\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{\tfrac{11}{2}}\right).
\]

\textbf{Step 3: Compute the dihedral angle}

For plane $AEF$, a normal vector $\vec n_1$ satisfies
\[
\vec n_1 \cdot \vec{AE} = 0, \qquad
\vec n_1 \cdot \vec{AF} = 0.
\]
Solving these equations yields a normal vector
\[
\vec n_1 = (0, \sqrt{11}, -2).
\]

Next, consider plane $AFC$. One verifies that diagonal $BD$ is perpendicular to both $AC$ and $PA$, hence $BD \perp$ plane $AFC$. Therefore, a normal vector of plane $AFC$ is
\[
\vec n_2 = \vec{BD} = (-\sqrt{3},\,3,\,0).
\]

Let $\phi$ be the dihedral angle between the two planes. Then
\[
\cos\phi
= \frac{|\vec n_1 \cdot \vec n_2|}{|\vec n_1|\,|\vec n_2|}
= \frac{3\sqrt{11}}{\sqrt{15}\,\sqrt{11}}
= \frac{3}{\sqrt{15}}
= \frac{\sqrt{15}}{5}.
\]

\bigskip

\textbf{Answer}

The cosine of the dihedral angle between the planes containing $\triangle AEF$ and $\triangle AFC$ is
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{15}}{5}}.
\]
