## 题目
An art gallery plans to construct a steel frame sunshade structure on an outdoor open space. Its geometric model can be simplified to a quadrangular pyramid $P-ABCD$. The base $ABCD$ is a horizontally placed rhombus steel plate with side length $2$, and $\angle ABC=60^\circ$. The lateral edge $PA$ is perpendicular to the plane $ABCD$, serving as the main support column perpendicular to the ground. Point $E$ is the midpoint of side $BC$, and point $F$ is the midpoint of the diagonal beam $PC$. A movable spotlight $H$ is installed on another diagonal beam $PD$. Measurements show that when the spotlight $H$ moves along $PD$ to a certain position, the angle between the connecting cable $EH$ and the side face $PAD$ reaches its maximum value, and at this time the tangent of this angle is $\sqrt{6}/2$. To reinforce the structure, engineers plan to install connecting components between the plane containing $ \triangle AEF $ and the plane containing $ \triangle AFC $. Please calculate the cosine of the dihedral angle between the planes containing $ \triangle AEF $ and $ \triangle AFC $.

## 解答
Step 1: Determine the spatial geometric parameters. Since the base $ABCD$ is a rhombus and $\angle ABC=60^\circ$, $\triangle ABC$ is an equilateral triangle. Connect $AE$. Since $E$ is the midpoint of $BC$, $AE\perp BC$.  Because $BC\parallel AD$, $AE\perp AD$. Given that $PA\perp$ plane $ABCD$, $PA\perp AE$. From $AE\perp AD$ and $AE\perp PA$, we have $AE\perp$ plane $PAD$. Let $\theta$ be the angle between $EH$ and plane $PAD$, then $\theta=\angle EHA$. In the right-angled triangle $\triangle EAH$, $\tan\theta=\frac{AE}{AH}$. $\theta$ is maximized when $AH$ is minimized (i.e., $AH\perp PD$). Given $AE=\sqrt{3}$ and $\tan\theta=\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$, we have $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{AH}=\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$, solving for $AH=\sqrt{2}$. In the right-angled triangle $\triangle PAD$, $AD=2$, and $AH=\sqrt{2}$ is the altitude to the hypotenuse, so $PA=2$. Step 2: Establish a spatial rectangular coordinate system. Using point $A$ as the origin, and rays $AE$, $AD$, and $AP$ as the positive directions of the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes respectively, we establish a spatial rectangular coordinate system. The coordinates of the points are $A(0,0,0)$, $B(\sqrt{3},-1,0)$, $C(\sqrt{3},1,0)$, $D(0,2,0)$, and $P(0,0,2)$. Using the midpoint formula, we get $E(\sqrt{3},0,0)$ and $F\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\frac{1}{2},1\right)$. Step 3: Calculate the normal vector and the dihedral angle. Let the normal vector of plane $AEF$ be $\vec n_1=(x,y,z)$. From $\vec n_1\cdot\vec{AE}=0$ and $\vec n_1\cdot\vec{AF}=0$, we get $\sqrt{3}x=0$ and $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}y+z=0$.  Let $z=-1$, then we solve for $\vec n_1=(0,2,-1)$. Connect $BD$. It is easy to prove that $BD\perp AC$ and $BD\perp PA$, therefore $BD\perp$ plane $AFC$.  Since $\vec{BD}=(-\sqrt{3},3,0)$, we can take it as a normal vector of plane $AFC$, i.e., $\vec n_2=(-\sqrt{3},3,0)$. Let the dihedral angle $E-AF-C$ be $\phi$, then $\cos\phi=\frac{|\vec n_1\cdot\vec n_2|}{|\vec n_1|\,|\vec n_2|}$. Substituting the values, we get $\cos\phi=\frac{6}{\sqrt{5}\,\sqrt{12}}=\frac{6}{2\sqrt{15}}=\frac{3}{\sqrt{15}}=\frac{\sqrt{15}}{5}$. Therefore, the cosine of the dihedral angle $E-AF-C$ is $\frac{\sqrt{15}}{5}$.

## 答案
$$\frac{\sqrt{15}}{5}$$
