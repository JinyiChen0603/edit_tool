## 题目
Topic: Discrete Optimization in Constrained Cascade Networks Problem Statement:In a digital signal processing chain, we have 5 sequential integer nodes $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5$.The system is subject to strict discrete constraints:Integer Constraint: All $x_i$ must be integers ($x_i \in \mathbb{Z}$).Conservation Constraint: The sum of the integers is exactly 5, i.e., $\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_i = 5$.Hard Boundaries: Each node value is confined within the range $[-3, 5]$. That is, $-3 \le x_i \le 5$ for all $i$.Define the Signal Cascade Product $P$ as:$$P = (x_1 + x_2)(x_2 + x_3)(x_3 + x_4)(x_4 + x_5)$$Calculate the Maximum and Minimum values of $P$.

## 解答
解析 (Solution)Let $y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4$ be the adjacent sums:$$y_1 = x_1+x_2, \quad y_2 = x_2+x_3, \quad y_3 = x_3+x_4, \quad y_4 = x_4+x_5$$The objective is to find the extrema of $P = y_1 y_2 y_3 y_4$.Constraint Analysis:Since $x_i \in [-3, 5]$, the range for any adjacent sum $y_i$ is $[-6, 10]$.The total sum is fixed: $\sum x_i = 5$.1. Finding the Maximum Value ($P_{max}$)To maximize the product, we can aim for either four positive factors or two positive and two negative factors. The latter strategy allows us to utilize large absolute values from the negative end of the range, often yielding a higher product than restricting ourselves to positive numbers.Strategy: "Positive-Positive-Negative-Negative" ConfigurationWe aim to maximize $y_1, y_2$ (positive) and maximize the absolute values of $y_3, y_4$ (negative).Set $x_1=5, x_2=5$ (Maximum upper bounds).$\Rightarrow y_1 = 10$.This consumes $10$ from the total sum. Remaining sum for $x_3, x_4, x_5$ is $5 - 10 = -5$.To keep $y_2$ positive and large, let $x_3$ be as large as possible without violating the negative requirement for $y_3$.Let $x_3 = 0$.$\Rightarrow y_2 = 5 + 0 = 5$.Now we need to distribute the remaining sum $-5$ to $x_4, x_5$ to make $y_3, y_4$ large negative numbers.Let $x_4 = -3$ (Lower bound).$\Rightarrow y_3 = 0 + (-3) = -3$.Finally, $x_5 = -5 - (-3) = -2$ (Valid, as $-2 \ge -3$).$\Rightarrow y_4 = -3 + (-2) = -5$.Verification:Sequence: $x = \{5, 5, 0, -3, -2\}$.Sum: $5+5+0-3-2 = 5$. (Valid)Range: All $\in [-3, 5]$. (Valid)Product: $P = 10 \times 5 \times (-3) \times (-5) = 50 \times 15 = 750$.Comparison: The best "all-positive" solution (e.g., $x=\{-3, 5, 0, 5, -2\}$) only yields $150$.Thus, Maximum is 750.2. Finding the Minimum Value ($P_{min}$)To minimize the product (largest negative value), we need an odd number of negative factors (1 or 3). The most efficient way is to create one highly negative factor and keep the other three factors as large positive numbers as possible.Pitfall Analysis (The Greedy Trap):A common mistake is to greedily maximize the single negative term to its limit, $-6$ (by setting adjacent nodes to -3, -3).Greedy Attempt: If we force $y_4 = -6$, the remaining resources allow a product of $6 \times 10 \times 2 \times (-6) = -720$.Global Optimization: We should slightly relax the negative term to allow the positive terms to grow.Optimal Strategy:Let's set the negative factor to -5 instead of -6, and see if we gain more from the positive factors.Target sequence for sums: High Positive, High Positive, Positive, Negative.Let $y_1 = -5$. This implies $x_1+x_2 = -5$.Set $x_1=-3, x_2=-2$.Remaining sum for $x_3, x_4, x_5$: $5 - (-5) = 10$.We want to maximize $y_2 y_3 y_4 = (-2+x_3)(x_3+x_4)(x_4+x_5)$ subject to sum 10.Set $x_3=5, x_4=5$ (Max upper bounds).Then $x_5 = 10 - 5 - 5 = 0$.Let's check the terms:$y_1 = -3 + (-2) = -5$.$y_2 = -2 + 5 = 3$.$y_3 = 5 + 5 = 10$.$y_4 = 5 + 0 = 5$.Verification:Sequence: $x = \{-3, -2, 5, 5, 0\}$.Sum: $-3-2+5+5+0 = 5$. (Valid)Range: All $\in [-3, 5]$. (Valid)Product: $P = (-5) \times 3 \times 10 \times 5 = -15 \times 50 = -750$.Since $|-750| > |-720|$, the value -750 is the true minimum.ConclusionThe maximum value is 750 and the minimum value is -750.
