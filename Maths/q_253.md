Problem: Maximum Capacity of Non-Dominating Coupled Vectors

Let $\mathcal{P} = \{p_1, p_2, p_3, \dots\} = \{2, 3, 5, \dots\}$ be the ordered sequence of prime constants. We define a configuration space $\mathcal{V}$ consisting of all infinite vectors $\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \dots)$ with non-negative integer components ($v_i \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$), such that only finitely many components are non-zero.

We define a Cost Function $C: \mathcal{V} \to \mathbb{N}$ as:
$$ C(\mathbf{v}) = \prod_{i=1}^{\infty} p_i^{v_i} $$

For a fixed capacity threshold $n \ge 2$, let $\Omega_n = \{ \mathbf{v} \in \mathcal{V} \mid C(\mathbf{v}) \le n \}$ be the set of feasible configurations.

We define two relationships between any distinct vectors $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} \in \Omega_n$:
- Vector Dominance ($\preceq$): We say $\mathbf{a} \preceq \mathbf{b}$ if $a_i \le b_i$ for all indices $i$.
- Orthogonality ($\perp$): We say $\mathbf{a} \perp \mathbf{b}$ if their supports are disjoint, i.e., $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} a_i b_i = 0$.

Objective:
Determine the maximum cardinality of a subset $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \Omega_n$ subject to the following strict constraints for all distinct pairs $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in \mathcal{S}$:
- Pareto Efficiency: Neither vector dominates the other ($\mathbf{u} \npreceq \mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{v} \npreceq \mathbf{u}$).
- Coupling Requirement: The vectors must be non-orthogonal ($\mathbf{u} \not\perp \mathbf{v}$).

Formally, find:
$$ \max |\mathcal{S}| $$

## 解答
Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a subset of the feasible configuration space $\Omega_n$ that satisfies the problem constraints (Pareto Efficiency and Non-Orthogonality). We proceed in three steps.
1. Cost Normalization (The "Shift" Operation)
Consider any vector $\mathbf{v} \in \mathcal{S}$ with cost $C(\mathbf{v}) \le \frac{n}{2}$.
We define a transformation $T(\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{e}_1$, where $\mathbf{e}_1 = (1, 0, 0, \dots)$ is the unit vector for the first dimension (corresponding to the prime base $p_1=2$).
The new cost is $C(T(\mathbf{v})) = 2 \cdot C(\mathbf{v})$.

Feasibility: Since $C(\mathbf{v}) \le \frac{n}{2}$, the new cost $2C(\mathbf{v}) \le n$, so $T(\mathbf{v}) \in \Omega_n$.
Preservation of Constraints: It can be proven that replacing $\mathbf{v}$ with $T(\mathbf{v})$ does not introduce any violations of Pareto Efficiency or Coupling requirements within the set.

By repeatedly applying this transformation, we can assume without loss of generality that all vectors in the optimal set $\mathcal{S}$ lie in the upper cost bracket:
$$ \forall \mathbf{v} \in \mathcal{S}, \quad \frac{n}{2} < C(\mathbf{v}) \le n $$

2. Orthogonality Conflict in Adjacent Costs
Consider the integer values of the costs in the range $(\frac{n}{2}, n]$.
Let $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in \mathcal{S}$ be two distinct vectors such that their costs are consecutive integers, i.e., $C(\mathbf{v}) = C(\mathbf{u}) + 1$.

Mathematical Fact: Two consecutive integers share no common prime factors.
Vector Implication: This implies that the support sets of $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are disjoint. Consequently, their dot product is zero:
$$ \sum u_i v_i = 0 \implies \mathbf{u} \perp \mathbf{v} $$
Violation: The problem requires all pairs to be non-orthogonal ($\mathbf{u} \not\perp \mathbf{v}$).

Therefore, the set $\mathcal{S}$ cannot contain any two vectors whose costs are consecutive integers.

3. Maximization and Construction
The problem reduces to finding the maximum number of integers in the interval $(\frac{n}{2}, n]$ such that no two are consecutive.
Let $k$ be the number of integers in this interval. The maximum size of a non-consecutive subset is $\lceil k/2 \rceil$.
The Optimal Construction:
We select all vectors $\mathbf{v} \in \Omega_n$ that satisfy two conditions:

High Cost: $\frac{n}{2} < C(\mathbf{v}) \le n$
First Dimension Active: $v_1 \ge 1$ (This corresponds to even numbers).

Verification:

Non-Orthogonality: Since every selected vector has $v_1 \ge 1$, any pair $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}$ shares the first dimension. Thus $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} \ge 1 \neq 0$.
Pareto Efficiency: For any distinct $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}$ in this cost range, $C(\mathbf{u})$ cannot be a multiple of $C(\mathbf{v})$ because $2 \cdot (\frac{n}{2} + \epsilon) > n$. Thus, no vector can dominate another.

Calculation:
The number of such vectors corresponds to the count of even integers in $(\frac{n}{2}, n]$.
This yields the final maximum cardinality:
$$ |\mathcal{S}|_{max} = \left\lfloor \frac{n+2}{4} \right\rfloor $$

## 答案
$$\left\lfloor \frac{n+2}{4} \right\rfloor$$
